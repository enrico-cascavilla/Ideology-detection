My libertarian friends are probably getting a little upset now but I think that's because they never appreciate the benefits of local fascism.,Ann Coulter,Right
"I have to say I'm all for public flogging. One type of criminal that a public humiliation might work particularly well with are the juvenile delinquents, a lot of whom consider it a badge of honor to be sent to juvenile detention. And it might not be such a cool thing in the 'hood' to be flogged publicly.",Ann Coulter,Right

"As quoted in ""Ann Slanders"" by Steve Rendall in Extra! (November/December 2002).",Ann Coulter,Right
"Her children knew she's sleeping with all these men. That just seems to me, it's the definition of ""not a good mother."" … Is everyone just saying here that it's okay to ostentatiously have premarital sex in front of your children? … [Diana is] an ordinary and pathetic and confessional — I've never had bulimia! I've never had an affair! I've never had a divorce! So I don't think she's better than I am.",Ann Coulter,Right
If those kids had been carrying guns they would have gunned down this one gunman. … Don't pray. Learn to use guns.,Ann Coulter,Right

"The New York Times is cheering the decision of Mount Holyoke College to stop requiring that students submit their SAT scores for admission, ending what the Times calls ""the tyranny of the big test."" While conceding that the SAT measures ""mental dexterity,"" the editorial complains that the test does not capture qualities such as ""motivation"" or what the student ""learned in high school.""  The SAT also doesn't measure compassion, speed or good looks. It does, however, measure something more than the ability to suck up to your high school teachers and guidance counselors.",Ann Coulter,Right
"It is true that some percentage of bright people really do not test well, but most of the time the only thing about ""common man's intelligence"" that is indubitably true is that it is common. The concept of some ephemeral, elusive nonverbal intelligence simply allows one to impute intelligence to anyone who strikes your fancy. … Eliminating standardized tests allows the cognitive elite to manipulate the soft stuff in ways the less-often-washed cannot. Mount Holyoke has accomplished nothing more than replacing a tyranny of merit with a tyranny of privilege.",Ann Coulter,Right
"In his fawning hagiography of Teddy Kennedy, Clymer wrote that Kennedy's liberal voting record made up for his killing that girl at Chappaquiddick. I didn't believe it either, but Clymer actually wrote: Kennedy's ""achievements as a senator have towered over his time, changing the lives of far more Americans than remember the name Mary Jo Kopechne."" (A review in The Washington Monthly said Clymer's Chappaquiddick section did ""not sugarcoat his subject's flaws."")  This is the way addled liberals really think. Even as they champion sucking the brains out of little babies, they think of themselves as indelibly compassionate because they favor an overweening, behemoth federal government.",Ann Coulter,Right
"The ethic of conservation is the explicit abnegation of man's dominion over the Earth. The lower species are here for our use. God said so: Go forth, be fruitful, multiply, and rape the planet — it's yours. That's our job: drilling, mining and stripping. Sweaters are the anti-Biblical view. Big gas-guzzling cars with phones and CD players and wet bars — that's the Biblical view.",Ann Coulter,Right
"Liberals are always frightened by diversity of opinion. They think a fair way to decide passionately contested issues is for the federal government to issue uncompromising edicts giving liberals everything they want, and then to suppress all criticism of the edicts. The fascistic order, completely supplanting all democratic processes, is then known as a victory for ""choice."" As the Grand Inquisitor said in  The Brothers Karamazov: ""They have vanquished freedom and have done so to make men happy.""  That's what the Supreme Court did in Roe vs. Wade, and has repeatedly done in periodic codicils to its original edict. Just this past term, in Stenberg vs. Carhart, the court expanded the apocryphal abortion right to an all-new right to stick a fork in the head of a half-born baby. The first lunacy keeps being rewritten to give abortion enthusiasts everything they could possibly want.",Ann Coulter,Right
"You remember what a fabulous success court-ordered ""desegregation"" plans have been. Few failures have been more spectacular. Illiterate students knifing one another between acts of sodomy in the stairwell is just one of the many eggs that had to be broken to make the left's omelette of transferring power from states to the federal government.",Ann Coulter,Right
"I think [women] should be armed but should not vote … women have no capacity to understand how money is earned. They have a lot of ideas on how to spend it … it's always more money on education, more money on child care, more money on day care.",Ann Coulter,Right
"God gave us the earth. We have dominion over the plants, the animals, the trees. God said, ""Earth is yours. Take it. Rape it. It's yours.""",Ann Coulter,Right
The presumption of innocence only means you don't go right to jail.,Ann Coulter,Right
"Airports scrupulously apply the same laughably ineffective airport harassment to Suzy Chapstick as to Muslim hijackers. It is preposterous to assume every passenger is a potential crazed homicidal maniac. We know who the homicidal maniacs are. They are the ones cheering and dancing right now.  We should invade their countries, kill their leaders and convert them to Christianity. We weren't punctilious about locating and punishing only Hitler and his top officers. We carpet-bombed German cities; we killed civilians. That's war. And this is war.",Ann Coulter,Right
"After the World Trade Center was bombed by Islamic fundamentalists in 1993, the country quickly chalked it up to a zany one-time attack and five minutes later decided we were all safe again. We weren't. We aren't now. They will strike again. Perhaps they will wait another eight years. But perhaps not.  The enemy is in this country right now. And any terrorists who are not already here are free to immigrate.",Ann Coulter,Right
"Not all Muslims may be terrorists, but all terrorists are Muslims — at least all terrorists capable of assembling a murderous plot against America that leaves 7,000 people dead in under two hours.  How are we to distinguish the peaceful Muslims from the fanatical, homicidal Muslims about to murder thousands of our fellow citizens?",Ann Coulter,Right
A cruise missile is more important than Head Start.,Ann Coulter,Right
"Taxes are like abortion, and not just because both are grotesque procedures supported by Democrats. You're for them or against them. Taxes go up or down; government raises taxes or lowers them. But Democrats will not let the words abortion or tax cuts pass their lips.",Ann Coulter,Right
"When contemplating college liberals, you really regret once again that John Walker is not getting the death penalty. We need to execute people like John Walker in order to physically intimidate liberals, by making them realize that they can be killed, too. Otherwise, they will turn out to be outright traitors.",Ann Coulter,Right
"Point one and point two by the end of the week had become official government policy. As for converting them to Christianity, I think it might be a good idea to get them on some sort of hobby other than slaughtering infidels. I mean perhaps that's the Peace Corps, perhaps it's working for Planned Parenthood, but I've never seen the transforming effect of anything like that of Christianity.",Ann Coulter,Right
There are a lot of bad Republicans; there are no good Democrats.,Ann Coulter,Right
My only regret with Timothy McVeigh is he did not go to the New York Times building.,Ann Coulter,Right
