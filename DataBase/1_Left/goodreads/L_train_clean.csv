1,Yanis Varoufakis,no,Left,"Most politicians cannot be theorists. First, because they are rarely thinkers; second, because the frenetic lifestyle they impose on themselves leaves no time for big ideas.

6,Yanis Varoufakis,no,Left,"Beneath the specific events that I experienced, I recognised a universal story – the story of what happens when human beings find themselves at the mercy of cruel circumstances that have been generated by an inhuman, mostly unseen network of power relations. This is why there are no ‘goodies’ or ‘baddies’ in this book. Instead, it is populated by people doing their best, as they understand it, under conditions not of their choosing. Each of the persons I encountered and write about in these pages believed they were acting appropriately, but, taken together, their acts produced misfortune on a continental scale. Is this not the stuff of authentic tragedy? Is this not what makes the tragedies of Sophocles and Shakespeare resonate with us today, hundreds of years after the events they relate became old news?",35287.0,0.0,1.0,beneath specific events experienced recognised universal story story happens human beings find mercy cruel circumstances generated inhuman mostly unseen network power relations goodies baddies book instead populated people best understand conditions choosing persons encountered write pages believed acting appropriately taken together acts produced misfortune continental scale stuff authentic tragedy makes tragedies sophocles shakespeare resonate us today hundreds years events relate became old news
7,Yanis Varoufakis,no,Left,"To put it slightly differently, small sovereign nations, like Iceland, have choices to make within the broader constraints created for them by nature and by the rest of humanity. However limited these choices might be, Iceland’s body politic retains absolute authority to hold their elected officials accountable for the decisions they have reached within the nation’s exogenous constraints, and to strike down every piece of legislation that it has decided upon in the past.

In the case of Greek state bonds, their buyers also knew that these were Greek law contracts, meaning that they could be given a haircut (written down) by a future stressed Greek government. This is precisely why the interest rates were higher than in Germany. Higher risk, higher rewards.

16,Yanis Varoufakis,no,Left,"While it would have been straightforward, and perfectly legal, to allow Irish banks or the Greek state to default to their private creditors (so as to respect the no-bailout clause), the authorities’ guilty desire to bail out the German and French banks (without telling taxpayers that this was what they were doing) led to the need to violate the no-bailout rule by concocting another rule: the no-default rule, which was never part of Europe’s original set of rules.

21,Yanis Varoufakis,no,Left,"Most Europeans like to think that American bankruptocracy is worse than its European cousin, thanks to the power of Wall Street and the infamous revolving door between the US banks and the US government. They are very, very wrong. Europe’s banks were managed so atrociously in the years preceding 2008 that the inane bankers of Wall Street almost look good by comparison. When the crisis hit, the banks of France, Germany, the Netherlands and the UK had exposure in excess of $30 trillion, more than twice the United States national income, eight times the national income of Germany, and almost three times the national incomes of Britain, Germany, France and Holland put together.8 A Greek bankruptcy in 2010 would have immediately necessitated a bank bailout by the German, French, Dutch and British governments amounting to approximately $10,000 per child, woman and man living in those four countries.

Was this a shrewd retailer’s response to market demand? No it was not. Who would want to buy almost four litres of pickles? Few family fridges had the necessary room for such an item. So what was the selling point? It was the idea of a huge quantity at an ultra-low price. Walmart’s customers, in this sense, were not buying pickles as such. They were buying into the symbolic value of cheapness; into the notion of having appropriated so many pickles for so little money.

27,Yanis Varoufakis,no,Left,"In reality, states never repay their debt. They roll it over, meaning they defer repayment endlessly, paying only the interest on the loans. As long as they can keep doing this, they remain solvent.10 It helps to think of public debt as a hole in the ground next to a mountain representing the nation’s total income. Day by day the hole gets steadily deeper as interest accrues on the debt, even if the state does not borrow more. But during the good times, as the economy grows, the income mountain is steadily getting taller. As long as the mountain rises faster than the debt hole deepens, the extra income added to the mountain’s summit can be shovelled into the adjacent hole, keeping its depth stable and the state solvent.

But given the state of self-confirming pessimism that prevails in the depths of a severe crisis, to expect that these beliefs will flood into the different agents’ minds at once is to believe in miracles. More likely, as we witnessed in Japan and in America, where QE was tried out with a vengeance, banks tend to lend the monies conjured up by the central bank not to other banks or to Jack and Jill but to companies. Except that these companies do not invest the borrowed money in machinery and workers, fearful that the demand will not be there for extra output produced. No, what they do is to buy back their own shares in the stock market in order to increase their shares’ price and collect a nice bonus for having added value to the company.

The obscene sight of those who had played a major role in setting the scene for the Crash (men like Larry Summers, Tim Geithner, Ben Bernanke) effectively returning to the scene of the crime as ‘saviours’, wielding trillions of freshly minted or borrowed dollars to lavish upon their banker ‘mates’, was enough to turn off even the hardiest of Mr Obama’s supporters. The result was predictable: as often happens during a deflationary period (think of the 1930s, for example), those who gainpolitically do not come from the revolutionary Left; they come from the loony Right. In the United States it was the Tea Party that grew on the back of a disdain for bankers, 6 a denunciation of the Fed, a clarion call for ‘honest’, metal-backed money, 7 and a revulsion towards all government. Ironically, the rise of the Tea Party increased the interventions of the Fed that the movement denounced. The reason was simple: once the Obama administration had lost its way, and could not pass any meaningful bills through Congress that might have stimulated the economy, onlyone lever was left with which anyone could steer America’s macroeconomy – the Fed’s monetary policy. And since interest rates were dwelling in the nether world of the first liquidity trap to hit the United States since the 1930s8 (recall Chapter 2 here), the Fed decided that quantitative easing or QE – the strategy that Chapter 8 describes in the context of the 1990s’ ‘lost Japanese decade’ – was all that was left separating America from a repugnant depression.",35775.0,0.0,1.0,quickly obama administration lost political momentum obscene sight played major role setting scene crash men like larry summers tim geithner ben bernanke effectively returning scene crime saviours wielding trillions freshly minted borrowed dollars lavish upon banker mates enough turn even hardiest mr obama supporters result predictable often happens deflationary period think s example gainpolitically come revolutionary left come loony right united states tea party grew back disdain bankers  denunciation fed clarion call honest metal backed money  revulsion towards government ironically rise tea party increased interventions fed movement denounced reason simple obama administration lost way could pass meaningful bills congress might stimulated economy onlyone lever left anyone could steer america macroeconomy fed monetary policy since interest rates dwelling nether world first liquidity trap hit united states since s recall chapter  fed decided quantitative easing qe strategy chapter  describes context s lost japanese decade left separating america repugnant depression

109,Yanis Varoufakis,no,Left,"In the meantime, it is useful to end this chapter by pondering a paradox. On the one hand, as already noted, economics is replete with eulogies to freedom (particularly of the market). However, on the other hand, the type of freedom that economics textbooks talk about is compatible with the science fiction image of rows and rows of persons attached to a pleasure machine which bombards them with utility (or, to be more respectful to ordinal utility, which keeps them at the very top of their preferences ordering). Less apocalyptically, it is consistent with a society in which individuals’ ideals have been reduced to purchasing commodities in gigantic shopping complexes guided totally by cravings manufactured in elaborate marketing clinics. Perhaps the most helpful conclusion to draw from all this is that the economic textbook’s model of rational choice is the culmination of the logic unleashed on the world by the emergence and domination of market societies (see Chapter 1 again). One question is worth keeping in mind when immersed in that logic: is a happy slave (a slave of feudal masters or, today, of the advertisers) capable of being free (whatever that person’s utility level)? So, if freedom is more than just desire-fulfilment what does it mean to be free?

114,Yanis Varoufakis,no,Left,"Chasing tax cheats using normal procedures was not an option. It would take decades just to identify anything like the majority of them and centuries to prosecute them successfully; the more we caught, the more clogged up the judicial system would become. We needed a different approach. Once Danis was on board a couple of days later, together we thought of one: we would extract historical and real-time data from the banks on all transfers taking place within Greece as well as in and out of the country and commission software to compare the money flows associated with each tax file number with the tax returns of that same file number. The algorithm would be designed to flag up any instance where declared income seemed to be substantially lower than actual income. Having identified the most likely offenders in this way, we would make them an offer they could not refuse. The plan was to convene a press conference at which I would make it clear that anyone caught by the new system would be subject to 45 per cent tax, large penalties on 100 per cent of their undeclared income and criminal prosecution. But as our government sought to establish a new relationship of trust between state and citizenry, there would be an opportunity to make amends anonymously and at minimum cost. I would announce that for the next fortnight a new portal would be open on the ministry’s website on which anyone could register any previously undeclared income for the period 2000–14. Only 15 per cent of this sum would be required in tax arrears, payable via web banking or debit card. In return for payment, the taxpayer would receive an electronic receipt guaranteeing immunity from prosecution for previous non-disclosure.17 Alongside this I resolved to propose a simple deal to the finance minister of Switzerland, where so many of Greece’s tax cheats kept their untaxed money.18 In a rare example of the raw power of the European Union being used as a force for good, Switzerland had recently been forced to disclose all banking information pertaining to EU citizens by 2017. Naturally, the Swiss feared that large EU-domiciled depositors who did not want their bank balances to be reported to their country’s tax authorities might shift their money before the revelation deadline to some other jurisdiction, such as the Cayman Islands, Singapore or Panama. My proposals were thus very much in the Swiss finance minister’s interests: a 15 per cent tax rate was a relatively small price to pay for legalizing a stash and allowing it to remain in safe, conveniently located Switzerland. I would pass a law through Greece’s parliament that would allow for the taxation of money in Swiss bank accounts at this exceptionally low rate, and in return the Swiss finance minister would require all his country’s banks to send their Greek customers a friendly letter informing them that, unless they produced the electronic receipt and immunity certificate provided by my ministry’s web page, their bank account would be closed within weeks. To my great surprise and delight, my Swiss counterpart agreed to the proposal.19",36256.0,0.0,1.0,chasing tax cheats using normal procedures option would take decades identify anything like majority centuries prosecute successfully caught clogged judicial system would become needed different approach danis board couple days later together thought one would extract historical real time data banks transfers taking place within greece well country commission software compare money flows associated tax file number tax returns file number algorithm would designed flag instance declared income seemed substantially lower actual income identified likely offenders way would make offer could refuse plan convene press conference would make clear anyone caught new system would subject  per cent tax large penalties  per cent undeclared income criminal prosecution government sought establish new relationship trust state citizenry would opportunity make amends anonymously minimum cost would announce next fortnight new portal would open ministry website anyone could register previously undeclared income period    per cent sum would required tax arrears payable via web banking debit card return payment taxpayer would receive electronic receipt guaranteeing immunity prosecution previous non disclosure  alongside resolved propose simple deal finance minister switzerland many greece tax cheats kept untaxed money  rare example raw power european union used force good switzerland recently forced disclose banking information pertaining eu citizens  naturally swiss feared large eu domiciled depositors want bank balances reported country tax authorities might shift money revelation deadline jurisdiction cayman islands singapore panama proposals thus much swiss finance minister interests  per cent tax rate relatively small price pay legalizing stash allowing remain safe conveniently located switzerland would pass law greece parliament would allow taxation money swiss bank accounts exceptionally low rate return swiss finance minister would require country banks send greek customers friendly letter informing unless produced electronic receipt immunity certificate provided ministry web page bank account would closed within weeks great surprise delight swiss counterpart agreed proposal

601,John Gray,no,Left,"Sometimes a kind of glory lights up the mind of a man. It happens to nearly everyone. You can feel it growing or preparing like a fuse burning toward dynamite. It is a feeling in the stomach, a delight of the nerves, of the forearms. The skin tastes the air, and every deep-drawn breath is sweet. Its beginning has the pleasure of a great stretching yawn; it flashes in the brain and the whole world glows outside your eyes. A man may have lived all of his life in the gray, and the land and trees of him dark and somber. The events, even the important ones, may have trooped by faceless and pale. And then -the glory- so that a cricket song sweetens his ears, the smell of the earth rises chanting to his nose, and dappling light under a tree blesses his eyes.

But only under one condition.John, I said, whirling around to clutch his arm again.Don’t get too excited, he warned. You haven’t heard the condition.Oh, I said, eagerly. Whatever it is, I’ll do it. Thank you. Alex has never had a very good life-his mother ran away when he was a baby, and his dad spent most of his life in jail…But, John, what is all this? I swept my free hand out to indicate the people remaining on the dock, waiting for the boat John had said was arriving soon. I’d noticed some of them had blankets like the one he’d wrapped around me. A new customer service initiative?John looked surprised at my change of topic…then uncomfortable. He stooped to reach for the driftwood Typhon had dashed up to drop at his feet. I don’t know what you mean, he said, stiffly.You’re giving blankets away to keep them warm while they wait. When did this start happening?You mentioned some things when you were here the last time….

So I decided to make a few changes.It felt as if one of the kind of flowers I liked-a wild daisy, perhaps-had suddenly blossomed inside my heart.Oh, John, I said, and rose onto my toes to kiss his cheek.He looked more than a little surprised by the kiss. I thought I might actually have seen some color come into his cheeks.What was that for? he asked.Henry said nothing was the same after I left. I assumed he meant everything was much worse. I couldn’t imagine it was the opposite, that things were better.John’s discomfort at having been caught doing something kind-instead of reckless or violet-was sweet.Henry talks too much, he muttered. But I’m glad you like it. Not that it hasn’t been a lot of added work. I’ll admit it’s cut down on the complaints, though, and even the fighting amongst our rowdier passengers. So you were right. Your suggestions helped.I beamed up at him.Keeper of the dead. That’s how Mr. Smith, the cemetery sexton, had referred to John once, and that’s what he was. Although the title protector of the dead seemed more applicable.It was totally silly how much hope I was filled with by the fact that he’d remembered something I’d said so long ago-like maybe this whole consort thing might work out after all.I gasped a moment later when there was a sudden rush of white feathers, and the bird he’d given me emerged from the grizzly gray fog seeming to engulf the whole beach, plopping down onto the sand beside us with a disgruntled little humph.Oh, Hope, I said, dashing tears of laughter from my eyes. Apparently I had only to feel the emotion, and she showed up. I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to leave you behind. It was his fault, you know. I pointed at John. The bird ignored us both, poking around in the flotsam washed ashore by the waves, looking, as always, for something to eat.Her name is Hope? John asked, the corners of his mouth beginning to tug upwards.No. I bristled, thinking he was making fun of me. Then I realized I’d been caught. Well, all right…so what if it is? I’m not going to name her after some depressing aspect of the Underworld like you do all your pets. I looked up the name Alastor.

Mining coal is dirty business, always has been. But it’s far worse now. Have you heard of mountaintop removal? No. Also known as strip-mining. They started mining coal in these parts back in the 1800s. Deep mining, where they bore tunnels into the mountains and extracted the coal. Mining has been a way of life here since then. My grandfather was a miner, so was his father. My dad was another story. Anyway, by 1920, there were 800,000 coal miners in the coalfields, from Pennsylvania down to Tennessee. Coal mining is dangerous work, and it has a rich history of labor troubles, union fights, violence, corruption, all manner of historical drama. All deep mining, which was the traditional way. Very labor-intensive. Around 1970, coal companies decided they could strip-mine and save millions on labor costs. Strip-mining is far cheaper than deep mining because it requires much fewer workers. Today there are only 80,000 coal miners left and half of them work above the ground, for the strip miners.",59233.0,0.0,1.0,well coal companies create lot problems anyway couple decent ones care nothing environment employees mining coal dirty business always far worse heard mountaintop removal also known strip mining started mining coal parts back s deep mining bore tunnels mountains extracted coal mining way life since grandfather miner father dad another story anyway    coal miners coalfields pennsylvania tennessee coal mining dangerous work rich history labor troubles union fights violence corruption manner historical drama deep mining traditional way labor intensive around  coal companies decided could strip mine save millions labor costs strip mining far cheaper deep mining requires much fewer workers today   coal miners left half work ground strip miners
705,John Gray,no,Left,"Mountaintop removal is nothing but strip-mining on steroids. Appalachian coal is found in seams, sort of like layers of a cake. At the top of the mountain there is the forest, then a layer of topsoil, then a layer of rock, and finally a seam of coal. Could be four feet thick, could be twenty. When a coal company gets a permit to strip-mine, it literally attacks the mountain with all manner of heavy equipment. First it clear-cuts the trees, total deforestation with no effort at saving the hardwoods. They are bulldozed away as the earth is scalped. Same for the topsoil, which is not very thick. Next comes the layer of rock, which is blasted out of the ground. The trees, topsoil, and rock are often shoved into the valleys between the mountains, creating what’s known as valley fills.

793,Terry Eagleton,no,Left,"In any case, it is a mistake to equate concreteness with things. An individual object is the unique phenomenon it is because it is caught up in a mesh of relations with other objects. It is this web of relations and interactions, if you like, which is 'concrete', while the object considered in isolation is purely abstract. In his Grundrisse, Karl Marx sees the abstract not as a lofty, esoteric notion, but as a kind of rough sketch of a thing. The notion of money, for example, is abstract because it is no more than a bare, preliminary outline of the actual reality. It is only when we reinsert the idea of money into its complex social context, examining its relations to commodities, exchange, production and the like, that we can construct a 'concrete' concept of it, one which is adequate to its manifold substance. The Anglo-Saxon empiricist tradition, by contrast, makes the mistake of supposing that the concrete is simple and the abstract is complex. In a similar way, a poem for Yury Lotman is concrete precisely because it is the product of many interacting systems. Like Imagist poetry, you can suppress a number of these systems (grammar, syntax, metre and so on) to leave the imagery standing proudly alone; but this is actually an abstraction of the imagery from its context, not the concretion it appears to be.

802,Terry Eagleton,no,Left,"The impotence of liberal humanism is a symptom of its essentially contradictory relationship to modern capitalism. For although it forms part of the ‘official’ ideology of such society, and the ‘humanities’ exist to reproduce it, the social order within which it exists has in one sense very little time for it at all. Who is concerned with the uniqueness of the individual, the imperishable truths of the human condition or the sensuous textures of lived experience in the Foreign Office or the boardroom of Standard Oil? Capitalism’s reverential hat-tipping to the arts is obvious hypocrisy, except when it can hang them on its walls as a sound investment. Yet capitalist states have continued to direct funds into higher education humanities departments, and though such departments are usually the first in line for savage cutting when capitalism enters on one of its periodic crises, it is doubtful that it is only hypocrisy, a fear of appearing in its true philistine colours, which compels this grudging support. The truth is that liberal humanism is at once largely ineffectual, and the best ideology of the ‘human’ that present bourgeois society can muster. The ‘unique individual’ is indeed important when it comes to defending the business entrepreneur’s right to make profit while throwing men and women out of work; the individual must at all costs have the ‘right to choose’, provided this means the right to buy one’s child an expensive private education while other children are deprived of their school meals, rather than the rights of women to decide whether to have children in the first place.",66452.0,0.0,1.0,impotence liberal humanism symptom essentially contradictory relationship modern capitalism although forms part official ideology society humanities exist reproduce social order within exists one sense little time concerned uniqueness individual imperishable truths human condition sensuous textures lived experience foreign office boardroom standard oil capitalism reverential hat tipping arts obvious hypocrisy except hang walls sound investment yet capitalist states continued direct funds higher education humanities departments though departments usually first line savage cutting capitalism enters one periodic crises doubtful hypocrisy fear appearing true philistine colours compels grudging support truth liberal humanism largely ineffectual best ideology human present bourgeois society muster unique individual indeed important comes defending business entrepreneur right make profit throwing men women work individual must costs right choose provided means right buy one child expensive private education children deprived school meals rather rights women decide whether children first place

It was as though this august entity had conﬁscated the abilities of men and women to determine their own existence, and was now doing so on their behalf. It also had the impudence to call this process ‘‘democracy.’’ Marx himself began his career as a radical democrat and ended up as a revolutionary one, as he came to realize just how much transformation genuine democracy would entail; and it is as a democrat that he challenges the state’s sublime authority. He is too wholehearted a believer in popular sovereignty to rest content with the pale shadow of it known as parliamentary democracy. He is not in principle opposed to parliaments, any more than was Lenin. But he saw democracy as too precious to be entrusted to parliaments alone. It had to be local, popular and spread across all the institutions of civil society. It had to extend to economic as well as political life. It had to mean actual self-government, not government entrusted to a political elite. The state Marx approved of was the rule of citizens over themselves, not of a minority over a majority. The state, Marx considered, had come adrift from civil society. There was a blatant contradiction between the two. We were, for example, abstractly equal as citizens within the state, but dramatically unequal in everyday social existence. That social existence was riven with conflicts, but the state projected an image of it as seamlessly whole. The state saw itself as shaping society from above, but was in fact a product of it.

837,Terry Eagleton,no,Left,"Marx was troubled by the question of why ancient Greek art retained an ‘eternal charm’, even though the social conditions which produced it had long passed; but how do we know that it will remain ‘eternally’ charming, since history has not yet ended? Let us imagine that by dint of some deft archaeological research we discovered a great deal more about what ancient Greek tragedy actually meant to its original audiences, recognized that these concerns were utterly remote from our own, and began to read the plays again in the light of this deepened knowledge. One result might be that we stopped enjoying them. We might come to see that we had enjoyed them previously because we were unwittingly reading them in the light of our own preoccupations; once this became less possible, the drama might cease to speak at all significantly to us.The fact that we always interpret literary works to some extent in the light of our own concerns - indeed that in one sense of ‘our own concerns’ we are incapable of doing anything else - might be one reason why certain works of literature seem to retain their value across the centuries. It may be, of course, that we still share many preoccupations with the work itself; but it may also be that people have not actually been valuing the ‘same’ work at all, even though they may think they have. ‘Our’ Homer is not identical with the Homer of the Middle Ages, nor ‘our’ Shakespeare with that of his contemporaries; it is rather that different historical periods have constructed a ‘different’ Homer and Shakespeare for their own purposes, and found in these texts elements to value or devalue, though not necessarily the same ones. All literary works, in other words, are ‘rewritten’, if only unconsciously, by the societies which read them; indeed there is no reading of a work which is not also a ‘re-writing’. No work, and no current evaluation of it, can simply be extended to new groups of people without being changed, perhaps almost unrecognizably, in the process; and this is one reason why what counts as literature is a notably unstable affair.",66847.0,0.0,1.0,marx troubled question ancient greek art retained eternal charm even though social conditions produced long passed know remain eternally charming since history yet ended let us imagine dint deft archaeological research discovered great deal ancient greek tragedy actually meant original audiences recognized concerns utterly remote began read plays light deepened knowledge one result might stopped enjoying might come see enjoyed previously unwittingly reading light preoccupations became less possible drama might cease speak significantly us fact always interpret literary works extent light concerns indeed one sense concerns incapable anything else might one reason certain works literature seem retain value across centuries may course still share many preoccupations work may also people actually valuing work even though may think homer identical homer middle ages shakespeare contemporaries rather different historical periods constructed different homer shakespeare purposes found texts elements value devalue though necessarily ones literary works words rewritten unconsciously societies read indeed reading work also writing work current evaluation simply extended new groups people without changed perhaps almost unrecognizably process one reason counts literature notably unstable affair

1131,Howard Zinn,no,Left,"It is not that the historian can avoid emphasis of some facts and not of others. This is as natural to him as to the mapmaker, who, in order to produce a usable drawing for practical purposes, must first flatten and distort the shape of the earth, then choose out of the bewildering mass of geographic information those things needed for the purpose of this or that particular map.My argument cannot be against selection, simplification, emphasis, which are inevitable for both cartographers and historians. But the map-maker's distortion is a technical necessity for a common purpose shared by all people who need maps. The historian's distortion is more than technical, it is ideological; it is released into a world of contending interests, where any chosen emphasis supports (whether the historian means to or not) some kind of interest, whether economic or political or racial or national or sexual.Furthermore, this ideological interest is not openly expressed in the way a mapmaker's technical interest is obvious (This is a Mercator projection for long-range navigation-for short-range, you'd better use a different projection). No, it is presented as if all readers of history had a common interest which historians serve to the best of their ability. This is not intentional deception; the historian has been trained in a society in which education and knowledge are put forward as technical problems of excellence and not as tools for contending social classes, races, nations.To emphasize the heroism of Columbus and his successors as navigators and discoverers, and to de-emphasize their genocide, is not a technical necessity but an ideological choice. It serves- unwittingly-to justify what was done. My point is not that we must, in telling history, accuse, judge, condemn Columbus in absentia. It is too late for that; it would be a useless scholarly exercise in morality. But the easy acceptance of atrocities as a deplorable but necessary price to pay for progress (Hiroshima and Vietnam, to save Western civilization; Kronstadt and Hungary, to save socialism; nuclear proliferation, to save us all)-that is still with us. One reason these atrocities are still with us is that we have learned to bury them in a mass of other facts, as radioactive wastes are buried in containers in the earth. We have learned to give them exactly the same proportion of attention that teachers and writers often give them in the most respectable of classrooms and textbooks. This learned sense of moral proportion, coming from the apparent objectivity of the scholar, is accepted more easily than when it comes from politicians at press conferences. It is therefore more deadly.The treatment of heroes (Columbus) and their victims (the Arawaks)-the quiet acceptance of conquest and murder in the name of progress-is only one aspect of a certain approach to history, in which the past is told from the point of view of governments, conquerors, diplomats, leaders. It is as if they, like Columbus, deserve universal acceptance, as if they-the Founding Fathers, Jackson, Lincoln, Wilson, Roosevelt, Kennedy, the leading members of Congress, the famous Justices of the Supreme Court-represent the nation as a whole. The pretense is that there really is such a thing as the United States, subject to occasional conflicts and quarrels, but fundamentally a community of people with common interests. It is as if there really is a national interest represented in the Constitution, in territorial expansion, in the laws passed by Congress, the decisions of the courts, the development of capitalism, the culture of education and the mass media.",73049.0,0.0,1.0,historian avoid emphasis facts others natural mapmaker order produce usable drawing practical purposes must first flatten distort shape earth choose bewildering mass geographic information things needed purpose particular map argument cannot selection simplification emphasis inevitable cartographers historians map maker distortion technical necessity common purpose shared people need maps historian distortion technical ideological released world contending interests chosen emphasis supports whether historian means kind interest whether economic political racial national sexual furthermore ideological interest openly expressed way mapmaker technical interest obvious mercator projection long range navigation short range better use different projection presented readers history common interest historians serve best ability intentional deception historian trained society education knowledge put forward technical problems excellence tools contending social classes races nations emphasize heroism columbus successors navigators discoverers de emphasize genocide technical necessity ideological choice serves unwittingly justify done point must telling history accuse judge condemn columbus absentia late would useless scholarly exercise morality easy acceptance atrocities deplorable necessary price pay progress hiroshima vietnam save western civilization kronstadt hungary save socialism nuclear proliferation save us still us one reason atrocities still us learned bury mass facts radioactive wastes buried containers earth learned give exactly proportion attention teachers writers often give respectable classrooms textbooks learned sense moral proportion coming apparent objectivity scholar accepted easily comes politicians press conferences therefore deadly treatment heroes columbus victims arawaks quiet acceptance conquest murder name progress one aspect certain approach history past told point view governments conquerors diplomats leaders like columbus deserve universal acceptance founding fathers jackson lincoln wilson roosevelt kennedy leading members congress famous justices supreme court represent nation whole pretense really thing united states subject occasional conflicts quarrels fundamentally community people common interests really national interest represented constitution territorial expansion laws passed congress decisions courts development capitalism culture education mass media

1184,Howard Zinn,no,Left,"Another view of the Constitution was put forward early in the twentieth century by the historian Charles Beard (arousing anger and indignation, including a denunciatory editorial in the New York Times). He wrote in his book An Economic Interpretation of the Constitution: Inasmuch as the primary object of a government, beyond the mere repression of physical violence, is the making of the rules which determine the property relations of members of society, the dominant classes whose rights are thus to be determined must perforce obtain from the government such rules as are consonant with the larger interests necessary to the continuance of their economic processes, or they must themselves control the organs of government. In short, Beard said, the rich must, in their own interest, either control the government directly or control the laws by which government operates. Beard applied this general idea to the Constitution, by studying the economic backgrounds and political ideas of the fifty-five men who gathered in Philadelphia in 1787 to draw up the Constitution. He found that a majority of them were lawyers by profession, that most of them were men of wealth, in land, slaves, manufacturing, or shipping, that half of them had money loaned out at interest, and that forty of the fifty-five held government bonds, according to the records of the Treasury Department. Thus, Beard found that most of the makers of the Constitution had some direct economic interest in establishing a strong federal government: the manufacturers needed protective tariffs; the moneylenders wanted to stop the use of paper money to pay off debts; the land speculators wanted protection as they invaded Indian lands; slaveowners needed federal security against slave revolts and runaways; bondholders wanted a government able to raise money by nationwide taxation, to pay off those bonds. Four groups, Beard noted, were not represented in the Constitutional Convention: slaves, indentured servants, women, men without property. And so the Constitution did not reflect the interests of those groups. He wanted to make it clear that he did not think the Constitution was written merely to benefit the Founding Fathers personally, although one could not ignore the $150,000 fortune of Benjamin Franklin, the connections of Alexander Hamilton to wealthy interests through his father-in-law and brother-in-law, the great slave plantations of James Madison, the enormous landholdings of George Washington.

1451,Howard Zinn,no,Left,"Until Americans can overcome this idealization of law, until they begin to see that law is, like other institutions and actions, to be measured against moral principles, against human needs, we will remain a static society in a world of change, a society deaf to the rising cries for justice- and therefore,a society in serious trouble.Added a quotation: The realities of american politics, it turns out, are different than as described in old civic textbooks, which tell us how fortunate we are to have the ballot. The major nominees for president are not chosen by the ballot, but are picked for us by a quadrennial political convention which is half farce, half circus, most of whose delegates have not been instructed by popular vote. For months before the convention, the public has been conditioned by the mass media on who is who, so that it will not be temped to think beyond that list which the party regulars have approved.Added a quotation: I do not think civil disobedience is enough; it is a way of protest, but in itself it does not construct a new society. There are many other things that citizens should do to begin to build a new way of life in the midst of the old, to live the way human beings should live- enjoying the fruits of the earth, the warmth of nature and of one another-without hostility, without the artificial separation of religion, or race, or nationalism. Further, not all forms of civil disobedience are moral; not all are effective.Added a quotation: It is very hard, in the comfortable environment of middle-class America, to discard the notion that everything will be better if we don't have the disturbance of civil disobedience, if we confine ourselves to voting, writing letters to our congressmen, speaking our minds politely.....somehow we must transcend our own tight, air-conditioned chambers and begin to feel their plight, their needs. It may become evident that, despite out wealth, we can have no real peace until they do.

Yet, in that moment of weakness she actually considered telling Ian everything she knew and letting him kill her if he wanted to; she would have preferred death to the torment of living with the memory of the lie that had been their lives-to the torment of living without him.Are you ill? he asked, frowning and minutely studying her face.Snatching at the excuse he’d offered, she nodded hastily. Yes. I haven’t been feeling well.Is that why you went to London? To see a physician?She nodded a little wildly, and to her bewildered horror he started to smile-that lazy, tender smile that always made her senses leap. Are you with child, darling? Is that why you’re acting so strangely? Elizabeth was silent, trying to debate the wisdom of saying yes or no-she should say no, she realized. He’d hunt her to the ends of the earth if he believed she was carrying his babe.No! He-the doctor said it is just-just-nerves.You’ve been working and playing too hard, Ian said, looking like the picture of a worried, devoted husband. You need more rest.Elizabeth couldn’t bear any more of this-not his feigned tenderness or his concern or the memory of Robert’s battered back. I’m going to sleep now, she said in a strangled voice. Alone, she added, and his face whitened as if she had slapped him.During his entire adult life Ian had relied almost as much on his intuition as on his intellect, and at that moment he didn’t want to believe in the explanation they were both offering. His wife did not want him in her bed; she recoiled from his touch; she had been away for two consecutive nights; and-more alarming than any of that-guilt and fear were written all over her pale face.Do you know what a man thinks, he said in a calm voice that belied the pain streaking through him, when his wife stays away at night and doesn’t want him in her bed when she does return?",87244.0,0.0,1.0,elizabeth snapped awake terrified instant door bed chamber flung open near dawn ian stalked darkened room want go first shall said tightly coming stand side bed mean asked trembling voice mean said either go first tell hell suddenly find company repugnant go first tell feel know want sent word nights sent damned note arrived long nightfall times informing intended sleep somewhere else want know men beaten like animals reminded stop shouting elizabeth said shakily getting bed dragging covers hide brows snapped together ominous frown elizabeth asked reaching touch cried bentner voice came doorway aught amiss lady asked glaring bravely ian get close damned door behind ian snapped furiously leave open elizabeth said nervously brave butler exactly said six long strides ian door shoving closed force sent crashing frame elizabeth began vibrate terror turned around started toward elizabeth tried back away tripped coverlet stay ian saw fear eyes stopped short inches front hand lifted winced came rest cheek darling asked voice made want weep feet beautiful baritone voice face harsh handsome face adored wanted beg tell robert wordsworth said lies lies life depends elizabeth fail us robert pleaded yet moment weakness actually considered telling ian everything knew letting kill wanted would preferred death torment living memory lie lives torment living without ill asked frowning minutely studying face snatching excuse offered nodded hastily yes feeling well went london see physician nodded little wildly bewildered horror started smile lazy tender smile always made senses leap child darling acting strangely elizabeth silent trying debate wisdom saying yes say realized hunt ends earth believed carrying babe doctor said nerves working playing hard ian said looking like picture worried devoted husband need rest elizabeth bear feigned tenderness concern memory robert battered back going sleep said strangled voice alone added face whitened slapped entire adult life ian relied almost much intuition intellect moment want believe explanation offering wife want bed recoiled touch away two consecutive nights alarming guilt fear written pale face know man thinks said calm voice belied pain streaking wife stays away night want bed return

1558,Judith Butler,no,Left,"According to Melanie Klein, we develop moral responses in reaction to questions of survivability. My wager is that Klein is right about that, even as she thwarts her own insight by insisting that it is the ego's survivability that is finally at issue. Why the ego? After all, if my survivability depends on a relation to others, to a you or a set of yous without whom I cannot exist, then my existence is not mine alone, but is to be found outside myself, in this set of relations that precede and exceed the boundaries of who I am. If I have a boundary at all, or if a boundary can be said to belong to me, it is only because I have become separated from others, and it is only on condition of this separation that I can relate to them at all. So the boundary is a function of the relation, a brokering of difference, a negotiation in which I am bound to you in my separateness. If I seek to preserve your life, it is not only because I seek to preserve my own, but because who I am is nothing without your life, and life itself has to be rethought as this complex, passionate, antagonistic, and necessary set of relations to others. I may lose this you and any number of particular others, and I may well survive those losses. But that can happen only if I do not lose the possibility of any you at all.

1561,Judith Butler,no,Left,"Leaning back in his chair, Ian listened to Larimore’s irate summation of the wild and fruitless chase he’d been sent on for two days by Lady Thornton and her butler: And after all that, Larimore flung out in high dudgeon, I returned to the house on Promenade Street to demand the butler allow me past the stoop, only to have the man-Slam the door in your face? Ian suggested dispassionately.No, my lord, he invited me in, Larimore bit out. He invited me to search the house to my complete satisfaction. She’s left London, Larimore finished, avoiding his employer’s narrowed gaze.She’ll go to Havenhurst, Ian said decisively, and he gave Larimore directions to find the small estate.When Larimore left, Ian picked up a contract he needed to read and approve; but before he’d read two lines Jordan stalked into his study unannounced, carrying a newspaper and wearing an expression Ian hadn’t seen before. Have you seen the paper today?Ian ignored the paper and studied his friend’s angry face instead. No, why?Read it, Jordan said, slapping it down on the desk. Elizabeth allowed herself to be questioned by a reporter from the Times. Read that. He jabbed his finger at a few lines near the bottom of the article about Elizabeth by one Mr. Thomas Tyson. That was your wife’s response when Tyson asked her how she felt when she saw you on trial before your peers.Frowning at Jordan’s tone, Ian read Elizabeth’s reply:My husband was not tried before his peers. He was merely tried before the Lords of theBritish Realm. Ian Thornton has no peers.Ian tore his gaze from the article, refusing to react to the incredible sweetness of her response, but Jordan would not let it go. My compliments to you, Ian, he said angrily. You serve your wife with a divorce petition, and she responds by giving you what constitutes a public apology! He turned and stalked out of the room, leaving Ian behind to stare with clenched jaw at the article. One month later Elizabeth had still not been found.

1562,Judith Butler,no,Left,"My dear, dear ladies, Sir Francis effused as he hastened forward, what a long-awaited delight this is! Courtesy demanded that he acknowledge the older lady first, and so he turned to her. Picking up Berta’s limp hand from her side, he presed his lips to it and said, Permit me to introduce myself. I am Sir Francis Belhaven.Lady Berta curtsied, her fear-widened eyes fastened on his face, and continued to press her handkerchief to her lips. To his astonishment, she did not acknowledge him at all; she did not say she was charmed to meet him or inquire after his health. Instead, the woman curtsied again. And once again. There’s hardly a need for all that, he said, covering his puzzlement with forced jovially. I’m only a knight, you know. Not a duke or even an earl.Lady Berta curtsied again, and Elizabeth nudged her sharply with her elbow. How do! burst out the plump lady.My aunt is a trifle-er-shy with strangers, Elizabeth managed weakly.The sound of Elizabeth Cameron’s soft, musical voice made Sir Francis’s blood sing. He turned with unhidden eagerness to his future bride and realized that it was a bust of himself that Elizabeth was clutching so protectively, so very affectionately to her bosom. He could scarcely contain his delight. I knew it would be this way between us-no pretense, no maidenly shyness, he burst out, beaming at her blank, wary expression as he gently took the bust of himself from Elizabeth’s arms. But, my lovely, there’s no need for you to caress a hunk of clay when I am here in the flesh.Momentarily struck dumb, Elizabeth gaped at the bust she’d been holding as he first set it gently upon its stand, then turned expectantly to her, leaving her with the horrifying-and accurate-thought that he now expected her to reach out and draw his balding head to her bosom. She stared at him, her mind in paralyzed chaos. I-I would ask a favor of you, Sir Francis, she burst out finally.Anything, my dear, he said huskily.I would like to-to rest before supper.He stepped back, looking disappointed, but then he recalled his manners and reluctantly nodded. We don’t keep country hours. Supper is at eight-thirty. For the first time he took a moment to really look at her. His memories of her exquisite face and delicious body had been so strong, so clear, that until then he’d been seeing the Lady Elizabeth Cameron he’d met long ago. Now he belatedly registered the stark, unattractive gown she wore and the severe way her hair was dressed. His gaze dropped to the ugly iron cross that hung about her neck, and he recoiled in shock. Oh, and my dear, I’ve invited a few guests, he added pointedly, his eyes on her unattractive gown. I thought you would want to know, in order to attire yourself more appropriately.Elizabeth suffered that insult with the same numb paralysis she’d felt since she set eyes on him. Not until the door closed behind him did she feel able to move. Berta, she burst out, flopping disconsolately onto the chair beside her, how could you curtsy like that-he’ll know you for a lady’s maid before the night is out! We’ll never pull this off.Well! Berta exclaimed, hurt and indignant. Twasn’t I who was clutching his head to my bosom when he came in.We’ll do better after this, Elizabeth vowed with an apologetic glance over her shoulder, and the trepidation was gone from her voice, replaced by steely determination and urgency. We have to do better. I want us both out of here tomorrow. The day after at the very latest.The butler stared at my bosom, Berta complained. I saw him!Elizabeth sent her a wry, mirthless smile.

1563,Judith Butler,no,Left,"Normally, Bentner would have beamed approvingly at the pretty portrait the girls made, but this morning, as he put out butter and jam, he had grim news to impart and a confession to make. As he swept the cover off the scones he gave his news and made his confession.We had a guest last night, he told Elizabeth. I slammed the door on him.Who was it?A Mr. Ian Thornton.Elizabeth stifled a horrified chuckle at the image that called to mind, but before she could comment Bentner said fiercely, I regretted my actions afterward! I should have invited him inside, offered him refreshment, and slipped some of that purgative powder into his drink. He’d have had a bellyache that lasted a month!Bentner, Alex sputtered, you are a treasure!Do not encourage him in these fantasies, Elizabeth warned wryly. Bentner is so addicted to mystery novels that he occasionally forgets that what one does in a novel cannot always be done in real life. He actually did a similar thing to my uncle last year.Yes, and he didn’t return for six months, Bentner told Alex proudly.And when he does come, Elizabeth reminded him with a frown to sound severe, he refuses to eat or drink anything.Which is why he never stays long, Bentner countered, undaunted. As was his habit whenever his mistress’s future was being discussed, as it was now, Bentner hung about to make suggestions as they occurred to him. Since Elizabeth had always seemed to appreciate his advice and assistance, he found nothing odd about a butler sitting down at the table and contributing to the conversation when the only guest was someone he’d known since she was a girl.It’s that odious Belhaven we have to rid you of first, Alexandra said, returning to their earlier conversation. He hung about last night, glowering at anyone who might have approached you. She shuddered. And the way he ogles you. It’s revolting. It’s worse than that; he’s almost frightening.Bentner heard that, and his elderly eyes grew thoughtful as he recalled something he’d read about in one of his novels. As a solution it is a trifle extreme, he said, but as a last resort it could work.Two pairs of eyes turned to him with interest, and he continued, I read it in The Nefarious Gentleman. We would have Aaron abduct this Belhaven in our carriage and bring him straightaway to the docks, where we’ll sell him to the press gangs.Shaking her head in amused affection, Elizabeth said, I daresay he wouldn’t just meekly go along with Aaron.And I don’t think, Alex added, her smiling gaze meeting Elizabeth’s, a press gang would take him. They’re not that desperate.There’s always black magic, Bentner continued. In Deathly Endeavors there was a perpetrator of ancient rites who cast an evil spell. We would require some rats’ tails, as I recall, and tongues of-No, Elizabeth said with finality.-lizards, Bentner finished determinedly.Absolutely not, his mistress returned.And fresh toad old, but procuring that might be tricky. The novel didn’t say how to tell fresh from-Bentner! Elizabeth exclaimed, laughing. You’ll cast us all into a swoon if you don’t desist at once.When Bentner had padded away to seek privacy for further contemplation of solutions, Elizabeth looked at Alex. Rats’ tails and lizards’ tongues, she said, chuckling. No wonder Bentner insists on having a lighted candle in his room all night.He must be afraid to close his eyes after reading such things, Alex agreed.",87255.0,0.0,1.0,normally bentner would beamed approvingly pretty portrait girls made morning put butter jam grim news impart confession make swept cover scones gave news made confession guest last night told elizabeth slammed door mr ian thornton elizabeth stifled horrified chuckle image called mind could comment bentner said fiercely regretted actions afterward invited inside offered refreshment slipped purgative powder drink bellyache lasted month bentner alex sputtered treasure encourage fantasies elizabeth warned wryly bentner addicted mystery novels occasionally forgets one novel cannot always done real life actually similar thing uncle last year yes return six months bentner told alex proudly come elizabeth reminded frown sound severe refuses eat drink anything never stays long bentner countered undaunted habit whenever mistress future discussed bentner hung make suggestions occurred since elizabeth always seemed appreciate advice assistance found nothing odd butler sitting table contributing conversation guest someone known since girl odious belhaven rid first alexandra said returning earlier conversation hung last night glowering anyone might approached shuddered way ogles revolting worse almost frightening bentner heard elderly eyes grew thoughtful recalled something read one novels solution trifle extreme said last resort could work two pairs eyes turned interest continued read nefarious gentleman would aaron abduct belhaven carriage bring straightaway docks sell press gangs shaking head amused affection elizabeth said daresay meekly go along aaron think alex added smiling gaze meeting elizabeth press gang would take desperate always black magic bentner continued deathly endeavors perpetrator ancient rites cast evil spell would require rats tails recall tongues elizabeth said finality lizards bentner finished determinedly absolutely mistress returned fresh toad old procuring might tricky novel say tell fresh bentner elizabeth exclaimed laughing cast us swoon desist bentner padded away seek privacy contemplation solutions elizabeth looked alex rats tails lizards tongues said chuckling wonder bentner insists lighted candle room night must afraid close eyes reading things alex agreed
1564,Judith Butler,no,Left,"Your butler informed me you were here. I thought-that is, I wondered how things were going.And since my butler didn’t know, Ian concluded with amused irritation, you decided to call on Elizabeth and see if you could discover for yourself?Something like that, the vicar said calmly. Elizabeth regards me as a friend, I think. And so I planned to call on her and, if you weren’t here, to put in a good word for you.Only one? Ian said mildly.The vicar did not back down; he rarely did, particularly in matters of morality or justice. Given your treatment of her, I was hard pressed to think of one. How did matters turn out with your grandfather?Well enough, Ina said, his mind on meeting with Elizabeth. He’s here in London.And?And, Ian said sardonically, you may now address me as ‘my lord.’I’ve come here, Duncan persisted implacably, to address you as ‘the bridegroom.’A flash of annoyance crossed Ian’s tanned features. You never stop pressing, do you? I’ve managed my own life for thirty years, Duncan. I think I can do it now.Duncan had the grace to look slightly abashed. You’re right, of course. Shall I leave?Ian considered the benefits of Duncan’s soothing presence and reluctantly shook his head. No. In fact, since you’re here, he continued as they neared the top step, you may as well be the one to announce us to the butler. I can’t get past him.Duncan lifted the knocker while bestowing a mocking glance on Ian. You can’t get past the butler, and you think you’re managing very well without me?Declining to rise to that bait, Ian remained silent. The door opened a moment later, and the butler looked politely from Duncan, who began to give his name, to Ian. To Duncan’s startled disbelief, the door came crashing forward in his face. An instant before it banged into its frame Ian twisted, slamming his shoulder into it and sending the butler flying backward into the hall and ricocheting off the wall. In a low, savage voice he said, Tell your mistress I’m here, or I’ll find her myself and tell her.With a glance of furious outrage the older man considered Ian’s superior size and powerful frame, then turned and started reluctantly for a room ahead and to the left, where muted voices could be heard.Duncan eyed Ian with one gray eyebrow lifted and said sardonically, Very clever of you to ingratiate yourself so well with Elizabeth’s servants.The group in the drawing room reacted with diverse emotions to Bentner’s announcement that Thornton is here and forced his way into the house. The dowager duchess looked fascinated, Julius looked both relived and dismayed, Alexandra looked wary, and Elizabeth, who was still preoccupied with her uncle’s unstated purpose for his visit, looked nonplussed.

1570,Judith Butler,no,Left,"This is from Elizabeth, it said. She has sold Havenhurst. A pang of guilt and shock sent Ian to his feet as he read the rest of the note: I am to tell you that this is payment in full, plus appropriate interest, for the emeralds she sold, which, she feels, rightfully belonged to you.Swallowing audibly, Ian picked up the bank draft and the small scrap of paper with it. On it Elizabeth herself had shown her calculation of the interest due him for the exact number of days since she’d sold the gems, until the date of her bank draft a week ago.His eyes ached with unshed tears while his shoulders began to rock with silent laughter-Elizabeth had paid him half a percent less than the usual interest rate.Thirty minutes later Ian presented himself to Jordan’s butler and asked to see Alexandra. She walked into the room with accusation and ire shooting from her blue eyes as she said scornfully, I wondered if that note would bring you here. Do you have any notion how much Havenhurst means-meant-to her?I’ll get it back for her, he promised with a somber smile. Where is she?Alexandra’s mouth fell open at the tenderness in his eyes and voice.Where is she? he repeated with calm determination.I cannot tell you, Alex said with a twinge of regret.You know I cannot. I gave my word.Would it have the slightest effect, Ian countered smoothly, if I were to ask Jordan to exert his husbandly influence to persuade you to tell me anyway?I’m afraid not, Alexandra assured him. She expected him to challenge that; instead a reluctant smile drifted across his handsome face. When he spoke, his voice was gentle. You’re very like Elizabeth. You remind me of her.Still slightly mistrustful of his apparent change of heart, Alex said primly, I deem that a great compliment, my lord.To her utter disbelief, Ian Thornton reached out and chucked her under the chin. I meant it as one, he informed her with a grin.Turning, Ian started for the door, then stopped at the sight of Jordan, who was lounging in the doorway, an amused, knowing smile on his face. If you’d keep track of your own wife, Ian, you would not have to search for similarities in mine. When their unexpected guest had left, Jordan asked Alex, Are you going to send Elizabeth a message to let her know he’s coming for her?Alex started to nod, then she hesitated. I-I don’t think so. I’ll tell her that he asked where she is, which is all he really did.He’ll go to her as soon as he figures it out.Perhaps.You still don’t trust him, do you? Jordan said with a surprised smile.I do after this last visit-to a certain extent-but not with Elizabeth’s heart. He’s hurt her terribly, and I won’t give her false hopes and, in doing so, help him hurt her again.Reaching out, Jordan chucked her under the chin as his cousin had done, then he pulled her into his arms. She’s hurt him, too, you know.Perhaps, Alex admitted reluctantly.Jordan smiled against her hair. You were more forgiving when I trampled your heart, my love, he teased.That’s because I loved you, she replied as she laid her cheek against his chest, her arms stealing around his waist.And will you love my cousin just a little if he makes amends to Elizabeth?I might find it in my heart, she admitted, if he gets Havenhurst back for her.It’ll cost him a fortune if he tries, Jordan chuckled. Do you know who bought it?No, do you?He nodded. Philip Demarcus.She giggled against his chest.

1571,Judith Butler,no,Left,"In the ensuing two weeks Ian managed to buy back Elizabeth’s emeralds and Havenhurst, but he was unable to find a trace of his wife. The town house in London felt like a prison, not a home, and still he waited, sensing somehow that Elizabeth was putting him through this torment to teach him some kind of well-deserved lesson.He returned to Montmayne, where, for several more weeks, he prowled about its rooms, paced a track in the drawing room carpet, and stared into its marble-fronted fireplaces as if the answer would be there in the flames. Finally he could stand it no more. He couldn’t concentrate on his work, and when he tried, he made mistakes. Worse, he was beginning to be haunted with walking nightmares that she’d come to harm-or that she was falling in love with someone kinder than he-and the tormenting illusions followed him from room to room.On a clear, cold day in early December, after leaving instructions with his footmen, butler, and even his cook that he was to be notified immediately if any word at all was received from Elizabeth, he left for the cottage in Scotland. It was the one place where he might find peace from the throbbing emptiness that was gnawing away at him with a pain that increased unbearably from day to day, because he no longer really believed she would ever contact him.",87383.0,0.0,1.0,ensuing two weeks ian managed buy back elizabeth emeralds havenhurst unable find trace wife town house london felt like prison home still waited sensing somehow elizabeth putting torment teach kind well deserved lesson returned montmayne several weeks prowled rooms paced track drawing room carpet stared marble fronted fireplaces answer would flames finally could stand concentrate work tried made mistakes worse beginning haunted walking nightmares come harm falling love someone kinder tormenting illusions followed room room clear cold day early december leaving instructions footmen butler even cook notified immediately word received elizabeth left cottage scotland one place might find peace throbbing emptiness gnawing away pain increased unbearably day day longer really believed would ever contact

Ian’s emotions veered from horror to hilarity, and the footman saw it.Miss Elizabeth, the footman pointedly informed Ian, does not know how to cook. She has always been much too busy to learn.Ian endured that reprimand without retort because he was thoroughly enjoying Elizabeth’s relaxed mood, and because she had actually been teasing him. As the huffy footman departed, however, Ian glanced at Jordan and saw his narrowed gaze on the man’s back, then he looked at Elizabeth, who was obviously embarrassed.They think they’re acting out of loyalty to me, she explained. They-well, they recognize your name from before. I’ll speak to them.I’d appreciate that, Ian said with amused irritation.

1573,Judith Butler,no,Left,"Elizabeth automatically started forward three steps, then halted, mesmerized. An acre of thick Aubusson carpet stretched across the book-lined room, and at the far end of it, seated behind a massive baronial desk with his shirtsleeves folded up on tanned forearms, was the man who had lied in the little cottage in Scotland and shot at a tree limb with her. Oblivious to the other three men in the room who were politely coming to their feet, Elizabeth watched Ian arise with that same natural grace that seemed so much a part of him. With a growing sense of unreality she heard him excuse himself to his visitors, saw him move away from behind his desk, and watched him start toward her with long, purposeful strides. He grew larger as he neared, his broad shoulders blocking her view of the room, his amber eyes searching her face, his smile one of amusement and uncertainty. Elizabeth? he said.Her eyes wide with embarrassed admiration, Elizabeth allowed him to lift her hand to his lips before she said softly, I could kill you.He grinned at the contrast between her words and her voice. I know.You might have told me.I hoped to surprise you.More correctly, he had hoped she didn’t know, and now he had his proof: Just as he had thought, Elizabeth had agreed to marry him without knowing anything of his personal wealth. That expression of dazed disbelief on her face had been real. He’d needed to see it for himself, which was why he’d instructed his butler to bring her to him as soon as she arrived. Ian had his proof, and with it came the knowledge that no matter how much she refused to admit it to him or to herself, she loved him.She could insist for now and all time that all she wanted from marriage was independence, and now Ian could endure it with equanimity. Because she loved him.Elizabeth watched the expressions play across his face. Thinking he was waiting for her to say more about his splendid house, she gave him a jaunty smile and teasingly said, ’Twill be a sacrifice, to be sure, but I shall contrive to endure the hardship of living in such a place as this.

1574,Judith Butler,no,Left,"At eight-thirty that night Ian stood on the steps outside Elizabeth’s uncle’s town house suppressing an almost overwhelming desire to murder Elizabeth’s butler, who seemed to be inexplicably fighting down the impulse to do bodily injury to Ian. I will ask you again, in case you misunderstood me the last time, Ian enunciated in a silky, ominous tone that made ordinary men blanch. Where is your mistress?Bentner didn’t change color by so much as a shade. Out! he informed the man who’d ruined his young mistress’s life and had now appeared on her doorstep, unexpected and uninvited, no doubt to try to ruin it again, when she was at this very moment attending her first ball in years and trying bravely to live down the gossip he had caused.She is out, but you do not know where she is?I did not say so, did I?Then where is she?That is for me to know and you to ponder.In the last several days Ian had been forced to do a great many unpleasant things, including riding across half of England, dealing with Christina’s irate father, and finally dealing with Elizabeth’s repugnant uncle, who had driven a bargain that still infuriated him. Ian had magnanimously declined her dowry as soon as the discussion began. Her uncle, however, had the finely honed bargaining instincts of a camel trader, and he immediately sensed Ian’s determination to do whatever was necessary to get Julius’s name on a betrothal contract. As a result, Ian was the first man to his knowledge who had ever been put in the position of purchasing his future wife for a ransom of $150,000.Once he’d finished that repugnant ordeal he’d ridden off to Montmayne, where he’d sopped only long enough to switch his horse for a coach and get his valet out of bed. Then he’d charged off to London, stopped at his town house to bathe and change, and gone straight to the address Julius Cameron had given him. Now, after all that, Ian was not only confronted by Elizabeth’s absence, he was confronted by the most insolent servant he’d ever had the misfortune to encounter. In angry silence he turned and walked down the steps. Behind him the door slammed shut with a thundering crash, and Ian paused a moment to turn back and contemplate the pleasure he was going to have when he sacked the butler tomorrow.",87386.0,0.0,1.0,eight thirty night ian stood steps outside elizabeth uncle town house suppressing almost overwhelming desire murder elizabeth butler seemed inexplicably fighting impulse bodily injury ian ask case misunderstood last time ian enunciated silky ominous tone made ordinary men blanch mistress bentner change color much shade informed man ruined young mistress life appeared doorstep unexpected uninvited doubt try ruin moment attending first ball years trying bravely live gossip caused know say know ponder last several days ian forced great many unpleasant things including riding across half england dealing christina irate father finally dealing elizabeth repugnant uncle driven bargain still infuriated ian magnanimously declined dowry soon discussion began uncle however finely honed bargaining instincts camel trader immediately sensed ian determination whatever necessary get julius name betrothal contract result ian first man knowledge ever put position purchasing future wife ransom $  finished repugnant ordeal ridden montmayne sopped long enough switch horse coach get valet bed charged london stopped town house bathe change gone straight address julius cameron given ian confronted elizabeth absence confronted insolent servant ever misfortune encounter angry silence turned walked steps behind door slammed shut thundering crash ian paused moment turn back contemplate pleasure going sacked butler tomorrow

A short while later Ian strolled out the French doors and started down the balcony steps to join her. She was bending down and snapping a withered rosebud from its stem. It only hurts for a moment, she told the bush, and it’s for your own good. You’ll see. With an embarrassed little smile she looked up at him. It’s a habit, she explained.It obviously works, he said with a tender smile, looking at the way the flowers bloomed about her skirts. How can you tell?Because, he said quietly as she stood up, until you walked into it, this was an ordinary garden.Puzzled, Elizabeth tipped her head. What is it now?Heaven.Elizabeth’s breath caught in her chest at the husky timbre of his voice and the desire in his eyes. He held out his hand to her, and, without realizing what she was doing, she lifted her hand and gave it to him, then she walked straight into his arms. For one breathless moment his smoldering eyes studied her face feature by feature while the pressure of his arms slowly increased, and then he bent his head. His sensual mouth claimed hers in a kiss of violent tenderness and tormenting desire while his hands slid over the sides of her breasts, and Elizabeth felt all her resistance, all her will, begin to crumble and disintegrate, and she kissed him back with her whole heart.",87387.0,0.0,1.0,finished meeting minutes later almost rudely ejected business acquaintances library went search elizabeth gardens lord butler informed short later ian strolled french doors started balcony steps join bending snapping withered rosebud stem hurts moment told bush good see embarrassed little smile looked habit explained obviously works said tender smile looking way flowers bloomed skirts tell said quietly stood walked ordinary garden puzzled elizabeth tipped head heaven elizabeth breath caught chest husky timbre voice desire eyes held hand without realizing lifted hand gave walked straight arms one breathless moment smoldering eyes studied face feature feature pressure arms slowly increased bent head sensual mouth claimed kiss violent tenderness tormenting desire hands slid sides breasts elizabeth felt resistance begin crumble disintegrate kissed back whole heart
1576,Judith Butler,no,Left,"I think, Berta remarked with a proud little smile when she was seated alone in the drawing room beside Elizabeth, he’s having second thoughts about proposing, milday.I think he was silently contemplating the easiest way to murder me at dinner, Elizabeth said, chuckling. She was about to say more when the butler interrupted them to announce that Lord Marchman wished to have a private word with Lady Cameron in his study.Elizabeth prepared for another battle of wits-or witlessness, she thought with an inner smile-and dutifully followed the butler down a dark hall furnished in brown and into a very large study where the earl was seated in a maroon chair at a desk on her right.You wished to see- she began as she stepped into his study, but something on the wall beside her brushed against her hair. Elizabeth turned her head, expecting to see a portrait hanging there, and instead found herself eye-to-fang with an enormous bear’s head. The little scream that tore from her was very real this time, although it owed to shock, not to fear.It’s quite dead, the earl said in a voice of weary resignation, watching her back away from his most prized hunting trophy with her hand over her mouth.Elizabeth recovered instantly, her gaze sweeping over the wall of hunting trophies, then she turned around.You may take your hand away from your mouth, he stated. Elizabeth fixed him with another accusing glare, biting her lip to hide her smile. She would have dearly loved to hear how he had stalked that bear or where he had found that monstrous-big boar, but she knew better than to ask. Please, my lord, she said instead, tell me these poor creatures didn’t die at your hands.I’m afraid they did.

1577,Judith Butler,no,Left,"For the next twenty minutes Elizabeth asked for concessions, Ian conceded, Duncan wrote, and the dowager duchess and Lucinda listened with ill-concealed glee.. In the entire time Ian made but one stipulation, and only after he was finally driven to it out of sheer perversity over the way everyone was enjoying his discomfort: He stipulated that none of Elizabeth’s freedoms could give rise to any gossip that she was cuckolding him.The duchess and Miss Throckmorton-Jones scowled at such a word being mentioned in front of them, but Elizabeth acquiesced with a regal nod of her golden head and politely said to Duncan, I agree. You may write that down. Ian grinned at her, and Elizabeth shyly returned his smile. Cuckolding, to the best of Elizabeth’s knowledge, was some sort of disgraceful conduct that required a lady to be discovered in the bedroom with a man who was not her husband. She had obtained that incomplete piece of information from Lucinda Throckmorton-Jones, who, unfortunately, actually believed it.Is there anything more? Duncan finally asked, and when Elizabeth shook her head, the dowager spoke up. Indeed, though you may not need to write it down. Turning to Ian, she said severely, If you’ve any thought of announcing this betrothal tomorrow, you may put it out of your head.Ian was tempted to invite her to get out, in a slightly less wrathful tone than that in which he’d ordered Julius from the house, but he realized that what she was saying was lamentably true. Last night you went to a deal of trouble to make it seem there had been little but flirtation between the two of you two years ago. Unless you go through the appropriate courtship rituals, which Elizabeth has every right to expect, no one will ever believe it.What do you have in mind? Ian demanded shortly.One month, she said without hesitation. One month of calling on her properly, escorting her to the normal functions, and so on.Two weeks, he countered with strained patience.Very well, she conceded, giving Ian the irritating certainty that two weeks was all she’d hoped for anyway. Then you may announce your betrothal and be wed in-two months!Two weeks, Ian said implacably, reaching for the drink the butler had just put in front of him.As you wish, said the dowager. Then two things happened simultaneously: Lucinda Throckmorton-Jones let out a snort that Ian realized was a laugh, and Elizabeth swept Ian’s drink from beneath his fingertips. There’s-a speck of lint in it, she explained nervously, handing the drink to Bentner with a severe shake of her head.Ian reached for the sandwich on his plate.Elizabeth watched the satisfied look on Bentner’s face and snatched that away, too. A-a small insect seems to have gotten on it, she explained to Ian.I don’t see anything, Ian remarked, his puzzled glance on his betrothed. Having been deprived of tea and sustenance, he reached for the glass of wine the butler had set before him, then realized how much stress Elizabeth had been under and offered it to her instead.Thank you, she said with a sigh, looking a little harassed. Bentner’s arm swopped down, scooping the wineglass out of her hand. Another insect, he said.Bentner! Elizabeth cried in exasperation, but her voice was drowned out by a peal of laughter from Alexandra Townsende, who slumped down on the settee, her shoulders shaking with unexplainable mirth.Ian drew the only possible conclusion: They were all suffering from the strain of too much stress.",87389.0,0.0,1.0,next twenty minutes elizabeth asked concessions ian conceded duncan wrote dowager duchess lucinda listened ill concealed glee entire time ian made one stipulation finally driven sheer perversity way everyone enjoying discomfort stipulated none elizabeth freedoms could give rise gossip cuckolding duchess miss throckmorton jones scowled word mentioned front elizabeth acquiesced regal nod golden head politely said duncan agree may write ian grinned elizabeth shyly returned smile cuckolding best elizabeth knowledge sort disgraceful conduct required lady discovered bedroom man husband obtained incomplete piece information lucinda throckmorton jones unfortunately actually believed anything duncan finally asked elizabeth shook head dowager spoke indeed though may need write turning ian said severely thought announcing betrothal tomorrow may put head ian tempted invite get slightly less wrathful tone ordered julius house realized saying lamentably true last night went deal trouble make seem little flirtation two two years ago unless go appropriate courtship rituals elizabeth every right expect one ever believe mind ian demanded shortly one month said without hesitation one month calling properly escorting normal functions two weeks countered strained patience well conceded giving ian irritating certainty two weeks hoped anyway may announce betrothal wed two months two weeks ian said implacably reaching drink butler put front wish said dowager two things happened simultaneously lucinda throckmorton jones let snort ian realized laugh elizabeth swept ian drink beneath fingertips speck lint explained nervously handing drink bentner severe shake head ian reached sandwich plate elizabeth watched satisfied look bentner face snatched away small insect seems gotten explained ian see anything ian remarked puzzled glance betrothed deprived tea sustenance reached glass wine butler set realized much stress elizabeth offered instead thank said sigh looking little harassed bentner arm swopped scooping wineglass hand another insect said bentner elizabeth cried exasperation voice drowned peal laughter alexandra townsende slumped settee shoulders shaking unexplainable mirth ian drew possible conclusion suffering strain much stress
1578,Judith Butler,no,Left,"They won’t do it, Ian, Jordan Townsende said the night after Ian was released on his own recognizance. Pacing back and forth across Ian’s drawing room, he said again, They will not do it.They’ll do it, Ian said dispassionately. The words were devoid of concern; not even his eyes showed interest. Days ago Ian had passed the point of caring about the investigation. Elizabeth was gone; there had been no ransom note, nothing whatever-no reason in the world to continue believing that she’d been taken against her will. Since Ian knew damned well he hadn’t killed her or had her abducted, the only remaining conclusion was that Elizabeth had left him for someone else.The authorities were still vacillating about the other man she’d allegedly met in the arbor because the gardener’s eyesight had been proven to be extremely poor, and even he admitted that it might have been tree limbs moving around her in the dim light, instead of a man’s arms. Ian, however, did not doubt it. The existence of a lover was the only thing that made sense; he had even suspected it the night before she disappeared. She hadn’t wanted him in her bed; if anything but a lover had been worrying her that night, she’d have sought the protection of his arms, even if she didn’t confide in him. But he had been the last thing she’d wanted.No, he hadn’t actually suspected it-that would have been more pain than he could have endured then. Now, however, he not only suspected it, he knew it, and the pain was beyond anything he’d ever imagined existed.I tell you they won’t bring you to trial, Jordan repeated. Do you honestly think they will? he demanded, looking first to Duncan and then to the Duke of Stanhope, who were seated in the drawing room. In answer, both men raised dazed, pain-filled eyes to Jordan’s, shook their heads in an effort to seem decisive, then looked back down at their hands.Under English law Ian was entitled to a trial before his peers; since he was a British lord, that meant he could only be tried in the House of Lords, and Jordan was clinging to that as if it were Ian’s lifeline.You aren’t the first man among us to have a spoiled wife turn missish on him and vanish for a while in hopes of bringing him to heel, Jordan continued, desperately trying to make it seem as if Elizabeth were merely sulking somewhere-no doubt unaware that her husband’s reputation had been demolished and that his very life was going to be in jeopardy. They aren’t going to convene the whole damn House of Lords just to try a beleaguered husband whose wife has taken a start, he continued fiercely. Hell, half the lords in the House can’t control their wives. Why should you be any different?Alexandra looked up at him, her eyes filled with misery and disbelief. Like Ian, she knew Elizabeth wasn’t indulging in a fit of the sullens. Unlike Ian, however, she could not and would not believe her friend had taken a lover and run away.Ian’s butler appeared in the doorway, a sealed message in his hand, which he handed to Jordan. Who knows? Jordan tried to joke as he opened it. Maybe this is from Elizabeth-a note asking me to intercede with you before she dares present herself to you.His smile faded abruptly.What is it? Alex cried, seeing his haggard expression.Jordan crumpled the summons in his hand and turned to Ian with angry regret.

1588,Judith Butler,no,Left,"An ethical query emerges in light of such an analysis: how might we encounter the difference that calls our grids of intelligibility into question without trying to foreclose the challenge that the difference delivers? What might it mean to learn to live in the anxiety of that challenge, to feel the surety of one’s epistemological and ontological anchor go, but to be willing, in the name of the human, to allow the human to become something other than what it is traditionally assumed to be? This means that we must learn to live and to embrace the destruction and rearticulation of the human in the name of a more capacious and, finally, less violent world, not knowing in advance what precise form our humanness does and will take. It means we must be open to its permutations, in the name of nonviolence. As Adriana Cavarero points out, paraphrasing Arendt, the question we pose to the Other is simple and unanswerable: who are you? The violent response is the one that does not ask, and does not seek to know. It wants to shore up what it knows, to expunge what threatens it with not-knowing, what forces it to reconsider the presuppositions of its world, their contingency, their malleability. The nonviolent response lives with its unknowingness about the Other in the face of the Other, since sustaining the bond that the question opens is finally more valuable than knowing in advance what holds us in common, as if we already have all the resources we need to know what defines the human, what its future life might be.",87667.0,0.0,1.0,ethical query emerges light analysis might encounter difference calls grids intelligibility question without trying foreclose challenge difference delivers might mean learn live anxiety challenge feel surety one epistemological ontological anchor go willing name human allow human become something traditionally assumed means must learn live embrace destruction rearticulation human name capacious finally less violent world knowing advance precise form humanness take means must open permutations name nonviolence adriana cavarero points paraphrasing arendt question pose simple unanswerable violent response one ask seek know wants shore knows expunge threatens knowing forces reconsider presuppositions world contingency malleability nonviolent response lives unknowingness face since sustaining bond question opens finally valuable knowing advance holds us common already resources need know defines human future life might

1592,Judith Butler,no,Left,"We might be tempted to understand the existence of injurious language as posing an ethical question on the order of: what kind of language ought we to use? How does the language we use affect others? If hate speech is citational, does that mean that the one who uses it is not responsible for that usage? Can one say that someone else made up this speech that one simply finds oneself using and thereby absolve oneself of all responsibility? I would argue that the citationality of discourse can work to enhance and intensify our sense of responsibility for it. The one who utters hate speech is responsible for the manner in which such speech is repeated, for reinvigorating such speech, for reestablishing contexts of hate and injury. The responsibility of the speaker does not consist of remaking language ex nihilo, but rather of negotiating the legacies of usage that constrain and enable that speaker’s speech. To understand this sense of responsibility, one afflicted with impurity from the start, requires that we understand the speaker as formed in the language that he or she also uses.

1593,Judith Butler,no,Left,"But what kind of speech is attributed to the citizen in such a view, and how does such an account draw the line between the performativity that is hate speech and the performativity that is the linguistic condition of citizenship? If hate speech is a kind of speech that no citizen ought to exercise, then how might its power be specified, if it can be? And how are both the proper speech of citizens and the improper hate speech of citizens to be distinguished from yet a third level of performative power, that which belongs to the state? This last seems crucial to interrogate if only because hate speech is itself described through the sovereign trope derived from state discourse (and discourse on the state). Figuring hate speech as an exercise of sovereign power implicitly performs a catachresis by which the one who is charged with breaking the law (the one who utters hate speech) is nevertheless invested with the sovereign power of law. What the law says, it does, but so, too, the speaker of hate.

Remember, they're not just your workers- they're your consumers, too. The more they spend their extra cash on your products, the more your profits go up. Also, when employees have enough money that they don't have to live in constant fear of bankruptcy, they're able to focus more on their work- and be more productive. With fewer personal problems and less stress hanging over them, they'll lose less time at work, meaning more profits for you. Pay them enough to afford a late model car (i.e. one that works), and they'll rarely be late for work. And knowing that they'll be able to provide a better life for their children will not only give them a more positive attitude, it'll give them hope- and an incentive to do well for the company because the better the company does, the better they'll do.Of course, if you're like most corporations these days- announcing mass layoffs right after posting record profits- then you're already hemorrhaging the trust and confidence of your remaining workforce, and your employees are doing their jobs in a state of fear.

1848,John Gray,no,Left,"Hobbes’s understanding of the dangers of anarchy resonates powerfully today. Liberal thinkers still see the unchecked power of the state as the chief danger to human freedom. Hobbes knew better: freedom’s worst enemy is anarchy, which is at its most destructive when it is a battleground of rival faiths. The sectarian death squads roaming Baghdad show that fundamentalism is itself a type of anarchy in which each prophet claims divine authority to rule. In well-governed societies, the power of faith is curbed. The state and the churches temper the claims of revelation and enforce peace. Where this kind is impossible, tyranny is better than being ruled by warring prophets. Hobbes is a more reliable guide to the present than the liberal thinkers who followed. Yet his view of human beings was too simple, and overly rationalistic. Assuming that humans dread violent death more than anything, he left out the most intractable sources of conflict. It is not always because human beings act irrationally that they fail to achieve peace. Sometimes it is because they do not want peace. They may want the victory of the One True Faith – whether a traditional religion or a secular successor such as communism, democracy or universal human rights. Or – like the young people who joined far-Left terrorist groups in the 1970s, another generation of which is now joining Islamist networks – they may find in war a purpose that is lacking in peace.

1849,John Gray,no,Left,"While it is much preferable to anarchy, government cannot abolish the evils of the human condition. At any time the state is only one of the forces that shape human behaviour, and its power is never absolute. At present, fundamentalist religion and organized crime, ethnic-national allegiances and market forces all have the ability to elude the control of government, sometimes to overthrow or capture it. States are at the mercy of events as much as any other human institution, and over the longer course of history all of them fail. As Spinoza recognized, there is no reason to think the cycle of order and anarchy will ever end. Secular thinkers find this view of human affairs dispiriting, and most have retreated to some version of the Christian view in which history is a narrative of redemption. The most common of these narratives are theories of progress, in which the growth of knowledge enables humanity to advance and improve its condition. Actually, humanity cannot advance or retreat, for humanity cannot act: there is no collective entity with intentions or purposes, only ephemeral struggling animals each with its own passions and illusions. The growth of scientific knowledge cannot alter this fact. Believers in progress – whether social democrats or neo-conservatives, Marxists, anarchists or technocratic Positivists – think of ethics and politics as being like science, with each step forward enabling further advances in future. Improvement in society is cumulative, they believe, so that the elimination of one evil can be followed by the removal of others in an open-ended process. But human affairs show no sign of being additive in this way: what is gained can always be lost, sometimes –as with the return of torture as an accepted technique in war and government – in the blink of an eye. Human knowledge tends to increase, but humans do not become any more civilized as a result.

Until a few centuries ago the Genesis story was known to be a myth – a poetic way of rendering truths that would otherwise be inaccessible. At the beginning of the Christian religion, Augustine warned against the dangers of literalism. The Jewish scholars who preceded him always viewed the Genesis story as a metaphor for truths that could not be accessed in any other way. It was only with the rise of modern science that the Genesis myth came to be misunderstood as an explanatory theory. Yet Darwinism was still a major threat to religion, for it confronted Victorians with the prospect of their final mortality.

To be sure, rationalists have repudiated the idea; but it is not long before they find they cannot do without it.

Here they are repeating a Zoroastrian theme, which was absorbed into later versions of monotheism: the belief that ‘as the “lord of creation” man is at the forefront of the contest between the powers of Truth and Untruth.’ But how to account for the fact that humankind is deaf to the voice of reason? At this point rationalists invoke sinister interests – wicked priests, profiteers from superstition, malignant enemies of enlightenment, secular incarnations of the forces of evil.

Modern rationalists reject the idea of evil while being obsessed by it. Seeing themselves as embattled warriors in a struggle against darkness, it has not occurred to them to ask why humankind is so fond of the dark.

1909,John Gray,no,Left,"In Leopardi’s view, the universal claims of Christianity were a licence for universal savagery. Because it is directed to all of humanity, the Christian religion is usually praised, even by its critics, as an advance on Judaism. Leopardi – like Freud a hundred years later – did not share this view. The crimes of medieval Christendom were worse than those of antiquity, he believed, precisely because they could be defended as applying universal principles: the villainy introduced into the world by Christianity was ‘entirely new and more terrible … more horrible and more barbarous than that of antiquity’. Modern rationalism renews the central error of Christianity – the claim to have revealed the good life for all of humankind. Leopardi described the secular creeds that emerged in modern times as expressions of ‘half-philosophy’, a type of thinking with many of the defects of religion. What Leopardi called ‘the barbarism of reason’ – the project of remaking the world on a more rational model – was the militant evangelism of Christianity in a more dangerous form. Events have confirmed Leopardi’s diagnosis. As Christianity has waned, the intolerance it bequeathed to the world has only grown more destructive.

It would be better, he told me in a conversation we had around this time, if Thatcher imposed a more drastic contraction on the economy so that the wage-setting power of the trade unions could be broken.

It seems that whoever is in charge of what to put on that page is given an edict that states:  “For God’s sake, try to be as bland as possible and by no means offend any one!” Thus, whenever something like Doonesbury would come along, it would be continually censored and, if lucky, eventually banished to the editorial pages. The message was clear: Keep it simple, keep it cute, and don’t be challenging, outrageous or political.  And keep it white!  It’s odd that considering all the black ink that goes into making the comics section (and color on Sundays) that you rarely see any black faces on that page. Well, maybe it’s not so odd after all, considering the makeup of most newsrooms in our country. It is even more stunning when you consider that in many of our large cities like New York, Los Angeles, or Chicago where the white population is barely a third of the overall citizenry, the comics pages seem to be one of the last vestiges of the belief that white faces are just…well, you know…so much more happy and friendly and funny!  Of course, the real funnies are on the front pages of most papers these days. That’s where you can see a lot of black faces. The media loves to cover black people on the front page. After all, when you live in a society that will lock up 30 percent of all black men at some time in their lives and send more of them to prison than to college, chances are a fair number of those black faces will end up in the newspaper.

And if we're interested in, let's say, diminishing the amount of violence in the world, it's at least arguable and sometimes true that a terroristic act does diminish the amount of violence in the world.

I speak of Senator Mansfield precisely because he is not a breast-beating superpatriot who wants America to rule the world, but is rather an American intellectual in the best sense, a scholarly and reasonable man -- the kind of man who is the terror of our age. Perhaps this is merely a personal reaction, but when I look at what is happening to our country, what I find most terrifying is not Curtis LeMay, with his cheerful suggestion that we bomb everybody back into the stone age, but rather the calm disquisitions of the political scientists on just how much force will be necessary to achieve our ends, or just what form of government will be acceptable to us in Vietnam.

It is not part of the spectrum of discussion.  The background for such a principled critique cannot be developed in the media, and the conclusions cannot be drawn.

2541,Noam Chomsky,,Left,"There have been times, however, when US officials have described what's going on in relatively frank terms; sometimes quite clearly. One put the matter in these words: ""The Central American area down to and including the Isthmus of Panama constitutes a legitimate sphere of influence for the United States [...] We do control the destinies of Central America and we do so for the simple reason that the national interest absolutely dictates such a course [...] We must decide whether we shall tolerate the interference of any other power in Central American affairs, or insist upon our own dominant position [...] Until now, Central America has always understood that governments that we recognize and support stay in power, while those we do not recognize and support, fall [...] Nicaragua has become a test case, it is difficult to see how we can afford to be defeated."" That's fairly familiar. These remarks were made by Under Secretary of State Robert Olds in 1927, and the outside power that he was concerned about was Mexico. [audience laughter] Mexico at that time was a Russian proxy. We were no longer fighting Huns in the Dominican Republic, now we were fighting Russians in Nicaragua, and in particular the Russian proxy Mexico. Mexico was then a proxy of the Bolsheviks, so the Marines had to be sent in, once again, and they established Somoza, and established the National Guard which was the basis for American power throughout the region, and in fact one of the most effective murder-incorporated forces down there for many years. They killed Sandino, he was killed off by stealth couple of years later, the guerilla leader. As President Coolidge sent the Marines in, he made the following declaration: ""Mexico is on trial before the world."" Mexico is on trial before the world as a proxy of the Soviet Union when we send the Marines into Nicaragua. Now things have changed a little bit, now it's Nicaragua that's threatening Mexico as a Russian proxy... But again there's the same conclusion, you know, kill the spics and the niggers and so on.

In these terms it falls well short of Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon, and cannot remotely be compared with the near-genocidal Indonesian invasion and annexation of East Timor, to mention only two cases of aggression that are still in progress, with continuing atrocities and with the crucial support of those who most passionately professed their outrage over Iraq's aggression. During the subsequent months, Iraq was responsible for terrible crimes in Kuwait, with several thousand killed and many tortured.

The losers of the war were the anti-fascist resistance, who were crushed all over the world. Either they were massacred like in Greece or South Korea, or just crushed like in Italy and France. That's the winners and losers. That tells you partly what the war was about. Now let's take the Cold War: Who's cheering and who's depressed? Let's take the East first.

That's what the Pentagon system is, in fact; it's the creation of a state-guaranteed market and subsidy system for high-technology production. There was a commitment under the Reagan Administration to protect this more powerful state from the public, which is regarded as the domestic enemy.

2573,Noam Chomsky,,Left,"Modern industrial civilization has developed within a certain system of convenient myths. The driving force of modern industrial civilization has been individual material gain, which is accepted as legitimate, even praiseworthy, on the grounds that private vices yield public benefits, in the classic formulation. Now, it has long been understood, very well, that a society that is based on this principle will destroy itself in time. It can only persist, with whatever suffering and injustice that it entails, as long as it is possible to pretend that the destructive forces that humans create are limited, that the world is an infinite resource, and that the world is an infinite garbage can. At this stage of history either one of two things is possible. Either the general population will take control of its own destiny and will concern itself with community interests, guided by values of solidarity, sympathy and concern for others, or alternatively there will be no destiny for anyone to control. As long as some specialized class is in a position of authority, it is going to set policy in the special interests that it serves. But the conditions of survival, let alone justice, require rational social planning in the interests of the community as a whole, and by now that means the global community. The question is whether privileged elite should dominate mass communication and should use this power as they tell us they must—namely to impose necessary illusions, to manipulate and deceive the stupid majority and remove them from the public arena. The question in brief, is whether democracy and freedom are values to be preserved or threats to be avoided. In this possibly terminal phase of human existence, democracy and freedom are more than values to be treasured; they may well be essential to survival.",,,,modern industrial civilization developed within certain system convenient myths driving force modern industrial civilization individual material gain accepted legitimate even praiseworthy grounds private vices yield public benefits classic formulation long understood well society based principle destroy time persist whatever suffering injustice entails long possible pretend destructive forces humans create limited world infinite resource world infinite garbage stage history either one two things possible either general population take control destiny concern community interests guided values solidarity sympathy concern others alternatively destiny anyone control long specialized class position authority going set policy special interests serves conditions survival let alone justice require rational social planning interests community whole means global community question whether privileged elite dominate mass communication use power tell us must namely impose necessary illusions manipulate deceive stupid majority remove public arena question brief whether democracy freedom values preserved threats avoided possibly terminal phase human existence democracy freedom values treasured may well essential survival
2574,Noam Chomsky,,Left,"Walter Lippmann … described what he called “the manufacture of consent” as “a revolution” in “the practice of democracy”... And he said this was useful and necessary because “the common interests” - the general concerns of all people - “elude” the public. The public just isn't up to dealing with them. And they have to be the domain of what he called a ""specialized class"" … [Reinhold Niebuhr]'s view was that rationality belongs to the cool observer.  But because of the stupidity of the average man, he follows not reason, but faith.  And this naive faith requires necessary illusion, and emotionally potent oversimplifications, which are provided by the myth-maker to keep the ordinary person on course. It's not the case, as the naive might think, that indoctrination is inconsistent with democracy. Rather, as this whole line of thinkers observes, it is the essence of democracy. The point is that in a military state or a feudal state or what we would now call a totalitarian state, it doesn't much matter because you've got a bludgeon over their heads and you can control what they do. But when the state loses the bludgeon, when you can't control people by force, and when the voice of the people can be heard, you have this problem—it may make people so curious and so arrogant that they don't have the humility to submit to a civil rule [Clement Walker, 1661], and therefore you have to control what people think.

It also threatens sanctions against countries that do not abide by its conveniently flexible notions of ""free trade."" In one important case, Washington has employed such threats with great effectiveness (and GATT approval) to force open Asian markets for U.S. tobacco exports and advertising, aimed primarily at the growing markets of women and children. The U.S. Agriculture Department has provided grants to tobacco firms to promote smoking overseas. Asian countries have attempted to conduct educational anti-smoking campaigns, but they are overwhelmed by the miracles of the market, reinforced by U.S. state power through the sanctions threat. Philip Morris, with an advertising and promotion budget of close to $9 billion in 1992, became China's largest advertiser. The effect of Reaganite sanction threats was to increase advertising and promotion of cigarette smoking (particularly U.S. brands) quite sharply in Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea, along with the use of these lethal substances. In South Korea, for example, the rate of growth in smoking more than tripled when markets for U.S. lethal drugs were opened in 1988. The Bush Administration extended the threats to Thailand, at exactly the same time that the ""war on drugs"" was declared; the media were kind enough to overlook the coincidence, even suppressing the outraged denunciations by the very conservative Surgeon-General.

The first thing they did was reconstitute the Mafia, as strikebreakers or for other such useful services. And the Mafia doesn't do it for fun, so there was a tradeoff: Essentially, they allowed them to reinstitute the heroin production system, which had been destroyed by the Fascists. The Fascists tended to run a pretty tight ship; they didn't want any competition, so they wiped out the Mafia. But the US reconstituted it, first in southern Italy, and then in southern France with the Corsican Mafia. That's where the famous French Connection comes from. That was the main heroin center for many years. Then US terrorist activities shifted over to Southeast Asia.

2605,Noam Chomsky,,Left,"Every year thousands of people, mostly children and poor farmers, are killed in the Plain of Jars in Northern Laos, the scene of the heaviest bombing of civilian targets in history it appears, and arguably the most cruel: Washington's furious assault on a poor peasant society had little to do with its wars in the region. The worst period was from 1968, when Washington was compelled to undertake negotiations (under popular and business pressure), ending the regular bombardment of North Vietnam. Kissinger-Nixon then decided to shift the planes to bombardment of Laos and Cambodia. The deaths are from ""bombies,"" tiny anti-personnel weapons, far worse than land-mines: they are designed specifically to kill and maim, and have no effect on trucks, buildings, etc. The Plain was saturated with hundreds of millions of these criminal devices, which have a failure-to-explode rate of 20%-30% according to the manufacturer, Honeywell. The numbers suggest either remarkably poor quality control or a rational policy of murdering civilians by delayed action. These were only a fraction of the technology deployed, including advanced missiles to penetrate caves where families sought shelter. Current annual casualties from ""bombies"" are estimated from hundreds a year to ""an annual nationwide casualty rate of 20,000,"" more than half of them deaths, according to the veteran Asia reporter Barry Wain of the Wall Street Journal -- in its Asia edition. A conservative estimate, then, is that the crisis this year is approximately comparable to Kosovo, though deaths are far more highly concentrated among children -- over half, according to analyses reported by the Mennonite Central Committee, which has been working there since 1977 to alleviate the continuing atrocities. There have been efforts to publicize and deal with the humanitarian catastrophe. A British-based Mine Advisory Group (MAG) is trying to remove the lethal objects, but the US is ""conspicuously missing from the handful of Western organizations that have followed MAG,"" the British press reports, though it has finally agreed to train some Laotian civilians.

2625,Noam Chomsky,,Left,"In Somalia, we know exactly what they had to gain because they told us. The chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Colin Powell, described this as the best public relations operation of the Pentagon that he could imagine. His picture, which I think is plausible, is that there was a problem about raising the Pentagon budget, and they needed something that would be, look like a kind of a cakewalk, which would give a lot of prestige to the Pentagon. Somalia looked easy. Let's look back at the background. For years, the United States had supported a really brutal dictator, who had just devastated the country, and was finally kicked out. After he's kicked out, it was 1990, the country sank into total chaos and disaster, with starvation and warfare and all kind of horrible misery. The United States refused to, certainly to pay reparations, but even to look. By the middle of 1992, it was beginning to ease. The fighting was dying down, food supplies were beginning to get in, the Red Cross was getting in, roughly 80% of their supplies they said. There was a harvest on the way. It looked like it was finally sort of settling down. At that point, all of a sudden, George Bush announced that he had been watching these heartbreaking pictures on television, on Thanksgiving, and we had to do something, we had to send in humanitarian aid. The Marines landed, in a landing which was so comical, that even the media couldn't keep a straight face. Take a look at the reports of the landing of the Marines, it must've been the first week of December 1992. They had planned a night, there was nothing that was going on, but they planned a night landing, so you could show off all the fancy new night vision equipment and so on. Of course they had called the television stations, because what's the point of a PR operation for the Pentagon if there's no one to look for it. So the television stations were all there, with their bright lights and that sort of thing, and as the Marines were coming ashore they were blinded by the television light. So they had to send people out to get the cameramen to turn off the lights, so they could land with their fancy new equipment. As I say, even the media could not keep a straight face on this one, and they reported it pretty accurately. Also reported the PR aspect. Well the idea was, you could get some nice shots of Marine colonels handing out peanut butter sandwiches to starving refugees, and that'd all look great. And so it looked for a couple of weeks, until things started to get unpleasant. As things started to get unpleasant, the United States responded with what's called the Powell Doctrine. The United States has an unusual military doctrine, it's one of the reasons why the U.S. is generally disqualified from peace keeping operations that involve civilians, again, this has to do with sovereignty. U.S. military doctrine is that U.S. soldiers are not permitted to come under any threat. That's not true for other countries. So countries like, say, Canada, the Fiji Islands, Pakistan, Norway, their soldiers are coming under threat all the time. The peace keepers in southern Lebanon for example, are being attacked by Israeli soldiers all the time, and have suffered plenty of casualties, and they don't like it. But U.S. soldiers are not permitted to come under any threat, so when Somali teenagers started shaking fists at them, and more, they came back with massive fire power, and that led to a massacre. According to the U.S., I don't know the actual numbers, but according to U.S. government, about 7 to 10 thousand Somali civilians were killed before this was over. There's a close analysis of all of this by Alex de Waal, who's one of the world's leading specialists on African famine and relief, altogether academic specialist. His estimate is that the number of people saved by the intervention and the number killed by the intervention was approximately in the same ballpark. That's Somalia.

[...] can we expect that with the existing power structure, distribution of power in the world, there will be humanitarian intervention? There is nothing new about the question, of course. The idea of humanitarian intervention goes back to the days of the Concert of Europe a century ago - in the 19th Century there was lots of talk about civilizing missions and interventions that would do good things.

And that much, at least, is fully recognized, even by the United States, which has overwhelming and, as I said, unilateral responsibility for these crimes. So George Bush No. 1, when he was the U.N. ambassador, back in 1971, he officially reiterated Washington's condemnation of Israel's actions in the occupied territories. He happened to be referring specifically to occupied Jerusalem. In his words, actions in violation of the provisions of international law governing the obligations of an occupying power, namely Israel. He criticized Israel's failure ""to acknowledge its obligations under the Fourth Geneva Convention as well as its actions which are contrary to the letter and spirit of this Convention."" [...] However, by that time, late 1971, a divergence was developing, between official policy and practice. The fact of the matter is that by then, by late 1971, the United States was already providing the means to implement the violations that Ambassador Bush deplored. [...] on December 5th [2001], there had been an important international conference, called in Switzerland, on the 4th Geneva Convention. Switzerland is the state that's responsible for monitoring and controlling the implementation of them. The European Union all attended, even Britain, which is virtually a U.S. attack dog these days. They attended. A hundred and fourteen countries all together, the parties to the Geneva Convention. They had an official declaration, which condemned the settlements in the occupied territories as illegal, urged Israel to end its breaches of the Geneva Convention, some ""grave breaches,"" including willful killing, torture, unlawful deportation, unlawful depriving of the rights of fair and regular trial, extensive destruction and appropriation of property not justified by military necessity and carried out unlawfully and wantonly. Grave breaches of the Geneva Convention, that's a serious term, that means serious war crimes. The United States is one of the high contracting parties to the Geneva Convention, therefore it is obligated, by its domestic law and highest commitments, to prosecute the perpetrators of grave breaches of the conventions. That includes its own leaders. Until the United States prosecutes its own leaders, it is guilty of grave breaches of the Geneva Convention, that means war crimes.

2664,Noam Chomsky,,Left,"In September [2002] the government announced the national security strategy. That is not completely without precedent, but it is quite new as a formulation of state policy.

In addition, we will assure that there is never any challenge to our domination because we are so overwhelmingly powerful in military force that we will simply crush any potential challenge. That caused shudders around the world, including the foreign policy elite at home which was appalled by this. It is not that things like that haven't been heard in the past. Of course they had, but it had never been formulated as an official national policy. I suspect you will have to go back to Hitler to find an analogy to that. Now, when you propose new norms in the international behavior and new policies you have to illustrate it, you have to get people to understand that you mean it. Also you have to have what a Harvard historian called an ""exemplary war"", a war of example, which shows that we really mean what we say. And we have to choose the right target. The target has to have several properties. First it has to be completely defenseless. No one would attack anybody who might be able to defend themselves, that would be not prudent.

Sure, you can imagine such things. Let's say you're in Iran right now. [audience laughter] It's under attack by the world's superpower, with embargoes... It's surrounded by states either occupied by its superpower enemy, or having nuclear weapons. Little way down the road is the regional superpower, which has hundreds of nuclear weapons, and other WMDs, and is essentially an offshore US military base. And has a bigger and more advanced air force than any NATO power, outside the United States. And in the past year has been supplied by the global superpower with 100 advanced jet bombers, openly advertised as able to fly to Iran and back to bomb it. And also provided with what the Hebrew press calls special weaponry, nobody knows what that means, but if you're an Iranian intelligence analyst you're going to give a worst case analysis, of course. And has actually been publicly provided with smart bombs, and deep penetration weapons... They have a terrific justification for anticipatory self defense, better than any other case I can think of. But would I approve of their bombing Israel, or carrying out terrorist acts in Washington? No, even though they have a pretty strong case, better than anything I can think of here.

2683,Noam Chomsky,,Left,"...evidence-based approach, the U.S. negotiators argued, is interference with free markets, because corporations must have the right to deceive. [...] The claim itself is kind of amusing, I mean, even if you believe the free market rhetoric for a moment. The main purpose of advertising is to undermine markets. If you go to graduate school and you take a course in economics, you learn that markets are systems in which informed consumers make rational choices. That's what's so wonderful about it. But that's the last thing that the state corporate system wants. It is spending huge sums to prevent that, which brings us back to the viability of American democracy. For many years, elections here, election campaigns, have been run by the public relations industry and each time it's with increasing sophistication. And quite naturally, the industry uses the same technique to sell candidates that it uses to sell toothpaste or lifestyle drugs. The point is to undermine markets by projecting imagery to delude and suppressing information, and similarly, to undermine democracy by the same method, projecting imagery to delude and suppressing information. The candidates are trained, carefully trained, to project a certain image.

He wrote the introduction to a recent book by his Director of Communications, John Norris, which presents the position of the Clinton administration at the time of the bombing. Norris writes that ""it was Yugoslavia's resistance to the broader trends of political and economic reform - not the plight of Kosovar Albanians - that best explains NATO's war"". In brief, they were resisting absorption into the U.S. dominated international socioeconomic system. Talbott adds that thanks to John Norris, anyone interested in the war in Kosovo ""will know … how events looked and felt at the time to those of us who were involved"" in the war, actually directing it. This authoritative explanation will come as no surprise at all to students of international affairs who are more interested in fact than rhetoric.

2699,Noam Chomsky,,Left,"Personally I'm very much opposed to Hamas' policies in almost every respect. However, we should recognize that the policies of Hamas are more forthcoming and more conducive to a peaceful settlement than those of the United States or Israel. ... So, for example, Hamas has called for a long-term indefinite truce on the international border. There is a long-standing international consensus that goes back over thirty years that there should be a two-state political settlement on the international border, the pre-June 1967 border, with minor and mutual modifications. That's the official phrase. Hamas is willing to accept that as a long-term truce. The United States and Israel are unwilling even to consider it... The demand on Hamas by the United States and the European Union and Israel [...] is first that they recognize the State of Israel. Actually, that they recognize its right to exist. Well, Israel and the U.S. certainly don't recognize the right of Palestine to exist, nor recognize any state of Palestine. In fact, they have been acting consistently to undermine any such possibility. The second condition is that Hamas must renounce violence. Israel and the United States certainly do not renounce violence. The third condition is that Hamas accept international agreements. The United States and Israel reject international agreements. So, though the policies of Hamas are, again in my view, unacceptable, they happen to be closer to the international consensus on a political peaceful settlement than those of their antagonists, and it's a reflection of the power of the imperial states - the United States and Europe - that they are able to shift the framework, so that the problem appears to be Hamas' policies, and not the more extreme policies of the United States and Israel...

And a lot of the settlers were allowed in, so there could be a pretense of violence, though there wasn't any... The withdrawal could have been done perfectly quietly. All that was necessary was for Israel to announce that on August 1st the army will withdraw. And immediately the settlers, who had been subsidized to go there in the first place, and to stay there, would get on to the trucks that are provided for them and move over to the West Bank where they can move into new subsidized settlements. But if you did that way, there wouldn't have been any national trauma, any justification for saying, ""never can we give up another 1 mm² of land"".

After Israel finally agreed to Sadat's 1971 offer, they had to evacuate northeastern Sinai, and there was another staged trauma, which again was ridiculed by Israel commentators.

2729,Noam Chomsky,,Left,"In the past, the United States has sometimes, kind of sardonically, been described as a one-party state: the business party with two factions called Democrats and Republicans. That’s no longer true. It’s still a one-party state, the business party. But it only has one faction. The faction is moderate Republicans, who are now called Democrats. There are virtually no moderate Republicans in what’s called the Republican Party and virtually no liberal Democrats in what’s called the Democratic [sic] Party. It’s basically a party of what would be moderate Republicans and similarly, Richard Nixon would be way at the left of the political spectrum today. Eisenhower would be in outer space. There is still something called the Republican Party, but it long ago abandoned any pretence of being a normal parliamentary party. It’s in lock-step service to the very rich and the corporate sector and has a catechism that everyone has to chant in unison, kind of like the old Communist Party.

2735,Noam Chomsky,,Left,"Turning finally to the question raised, to be precise, it appears that [Hillary] Clinton received a slight majority of the vote. The apparent decisive victory [of Donald Trump] has to do with curious features of American politics: among other factors, the Electoral College residue of the founding of the country as an alliance of separate states; the winner-take-all system in each state; the arrangement of congressional districts (sometimes by gerrymandering) to provide greater weight to rural votes (in past elections, and probably this one too, Democrats have had a comfortable margin of victory in the popular vote for the House, but hold a minority of seats); the very high rate of abstention (usually close to half in presidential elections, this one included). Of some significance for the future is the fact that in the age 18-25 range, Clinton won handily, and Sanders had an even higher level of support. How much this matters depends on what kind of future humanity will face.",,,,turning finally question raised precise appears hillary clinton received slight majority vote apparent decisive victory donald trump curious features american politics among factors electoral college residue founding country alliance separate states winner take system state arrangement congressional districts sometimes gerrymandering provide greater weight rural votes past elections probably one democrats comfortable margin victory popular vote house hold minority seats high rate abstention usually close half presidential elections one included significance future fact age   range clinton handily sanders even higher level support much matters depends kind future humanity face

These sanctions have cut off the means by which the Venezuelan government could escape from its economic recession, while causing a dramatic falloff in oil production and worsening the economic crisis, and causing many people to die because they can’t get access to life-saving medicines.
