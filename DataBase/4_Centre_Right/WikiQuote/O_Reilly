"Winston Churchill said that democracy was the worst possible form of government, except for all the others. Maybe we can say the same about capitalism. For all of its faults, it gives most hardworking people a chance to improve themselves economically, even as the deck is stacked in favor of the privileged few...  Here are the choices most of us face in such a system: Get bitter or get busy.",Bill O'Reilly (commentator),Conservatives
I don't care about the Constitution!,Bill O'Reilly (commentator),Conservatives
Saddam Hussein... I believe is involved with this World Trade Center and Pentagon bombing. I believe that you're going to find out that money from Iraq flowed in and helped this happen.,Bill O'Reilly (commentator),Conservatives
"I want to quote this— ""On my honor, I will do my best to do my duty to God and to my country and obey Scout law"", on and on and on and on. I mean, God's in the first 10 words. So – why did you have to tell them you were an atheist if you didn't have any trouble reading the oath? Why didn't you just shut up?",Bill O'Reilly (commentator),Conservatives
"I wouldn't read the book, and I'll tell you why. I wouldna read Mein Kampf either. If I were going to UNC in 1941, and you, professor, said read Mein Kampf, I woulda said, ""Hey, professor, with all due respect, shove it. I ain't reading it.""",Bill O'Reilly (commentator),Conservatives
"Paula Evan, Winston-Salem North Carolina: ""Bill, if you are so concerned about public figures being bad role models for children please stop rudely interrupting your guest and telling them to shut up!"" Well, the 'shut up' line has happened only once in six years, Miss Evans.",Bill O'Reilly (commentator),Conservatives
Our military machine will crush Iraq in a matter of days and there's no question that it will.,Bill O'Reilly (commentator),Conservatives
"[to guest saying the war is ""going to go on for months""] There's no way. There's absolutely no way. They may bomb for a matter of weeks, try to soften them up as they did in Afghanistan. But once the United States and Britain unleash, it's maybe hours. They're going to fold like that.",Bill O'Reilly (commentator),Conservatives
"Once the war against Saddam Hussein begins, we expect every American to support our military, and if you can't do that, just shut up. Americans, and indeed our foreign allies, who actively work against our military once the war is underway, will be considered enemies of the state by me. Just fair warning to you, Barbara Streisand and others who see the world as you do. I don't want to demonize anyone, but anyone who hurts this country in a time like this, well — let's just say you will be spotlighted.",Bill O'Reilly (commentator),Conservatives
"Think about this — some of us actively fighting to remove Saddam Hussein don't agree with the cause themselves, but they're doing their duty. And it is our duty as loyal Americans to shut up once the fighting begins, unless — unless facts prove the operation wrong, as was the case in Vietnam.",Bill O'Reilly (commentator),Conservatives
"If the Americans go in and overthrow Saddam Hussein and it's clean, he has nothing, I will apologize to the nation, and I will not trust the Bush Administration again, all right?",Bill O'Reilly (commentator),Conservatives
"I was wrong. I am not pleased about it at all and I think all Americans should be concerned about this… What do you want me to do, go over and kiss the camera?",Bill O'Reilly (commentator),Conservatives
"I go on Good Morning America yesterday and say that I'm personally sorry my analysis on WMDs before the war was wrong and I'm angry about the CIA mistake. I mean, any honest commentator would say that, but the left-wing press sees my admission as some kind of liberal policy vindication and is using my words to hammer the president. Well, that's dishonest. I still believe removing Saddam was the right thing to do and that history will prove it. And there's also the possibility that WMDs will be found, so I might have to apologize for my apology. I don't mind. I still hope they find WMDs.",Bill O'Reilly (commentator),Conservatives

"There is no question that Whoopi Goldberg's foolish comments at a John Kerry fundraiser hurt Kerry — who had no idea how to handle the situation. Chevy Chase should have learned from that. Even he has to know that calling the president of the United States an ""F"" is not going to be accepted by most Americans. Now you don't see this kind of thing on the right. You don't see prominent conservatives cursing out Democratic members of Congress, for example.  Now I know talk radio can get rough but nothing like what these Hollywood nitwits are throwing out there.",Bill O'Reilly (commentator),Conservatives
"I'll tell you what. I've been in combat. I've seen it, I've been close to it... and if my unit is in danger, and I've got a captured guy, and the guy knows where the enemy is, and I'm looking him in the eye, the guy better tell me. That's all I'm gonna tell you. The guy better tell me. If it's life or death, he's going first.",Bill O'Reilly (commentator),Conservatives
"Roger from Portland
You just said you've been in combat, but you've never been in the military, have you?
Bill O'Reilly
No, I have not.
Roger from Portland
Then why do you say you've been in combat?
Bill O'Reilly
Why do I say that, Roger? Because I was in the middle of a couple of firefights in South and Central America.
Roger from Portland
But you were a media guy.
Bill O'Reilly
Yeah. A media guy with a pen, not a gun. And people were shooting at me, Roger.",Bill O'Reilly (commentator),Conservatives
"I just wish Katrina had only hit the United Nations building, nothing else, just had flooded them out, and I wouldn't have rescued them.",Bill O'Reilly (commentator),Conservatives
"If I'm the president of the United States, I walk right into Union Square, I set up my little presidential podium, and I say, ""Listen, citizens of San Francisco, if you vote against military recruiting, you're not going to get another nickel in federal funds. Fine. You want to be your own country? Go right ahead. And if Al-Qaeda comes in here and blows you up, we're not going to do anything about it. We're going to say, look, every other place in America is off limits to you, except San Francisco. You want to blow up the Coit Tower? Go ahead.""",Bill O'Reilly (commentator),Conservatives
"Most people showed up, and I think there were, like, 1,300 of them, to hear what the woman had to say. These far-left Nazis— and that's what they are, OK?— came in, not only insulted Ms. Coulter but violated the rights of the people who came to hear what she had to say. This is unacceptable on every level. And it's unacceptable to do what they do on their websites: to defame, to lie, to do whatever, you know, sleazy thing they can think of to people with whom they disagree.",Bill O'Reilly (commentator),Conservatives
"David Letterman
How can you possibly take exception with the motivation and the position of someone like Cindy Sheehan?
Bill O'Reilly
Because I think she's run by far-left elements in this country. I feel bad for the woman.
David Letterman
Have you lost family members in armed conflict?
Bill O'Reilly
No, I have not.
David Letterman
Well, then you can hardly speak for her, can you?",Bill O'Reilly (commentator),Conservatives
"When I die, I don't want my demise to be used as a political rally, and that's what happened yesterday.",Bill O'Reilly (commentator),Conservatives
"I'm not buying this.  If, if you're eleven years old, or twelve years old, thirteen, and you have a strong bond with your family, OK.  Even if the guy [kidnapper] threatens you - this and that. … If you can get away, you get away.",Bill O'Reilly (commentator),Conservatives
"Bill O'Reilly
I'm effete. I'm not a tough guy. This is all an act.
Stephen Colbert
You're breaking my heart, Bill.
Bill O'Reilly
I'm sensitive, y'know, I'm a—
Stephen Colbert
If you're an act, then what am I?",Bill O'Reilly (commentator),Conservatives
"The Soros-Lewis mob despises Fox News because we have their number and report on them accurately. They use the MoveOn website to smear this network and others with whom they disagree. These people use propaganda techniques perfected by Dr. Joseph Goebbels, the Nazi minister of information. They lie, distort, defame all the time.",Bill O'Reilly (commentator),Conservatives
"America today is a confused society, caught up in a terror war, a culture war, and a media war, where honesty and professional standards have vanished.",Bill O'Reilly (commentator),Conservatives
"Bill O'Reilly
I think it takes more faith to be like you, an atheist, than like me, a believer, and it's because of nature. You know, I just don't think we could've lucked out to have the tides come in, the tides go out, sun go up, sun go down. Don't think it could've happened.
Richard Dawkins
We have a very full understanding of why the tides go in, the tides go out, of why the continents drift about, of why life is there. Science is ever more piling on the evidence, piling on the understanding.
Bill O'Reilly
But it had to get there, I understand that you, you know, the uh, physiology of it if you will, but it had to come from somewhere.",Bill O'Reilly (commentator),Conservatives
"The hate websites on both the left and the right— I object to. You know I object to. Now, you're a little bit more a libertarian about this in our previous conversations. But I say this. There's no difference between the KKK and the Nazis, who have websites, than the Daily Kos. Because the Daily Kos is basically saying, ""We're allowing this kind of thing to come on."" It's good that Tony Snow has a recurrence of cancer; we hope he dies. We're sorry the assassination attempt against Dick Cheney failed; let them try again. And on and on and on and on.",Bill O'Reilly (commentator),Conservatives
This is the worst stuff on the Internet. There isn't anything worse than this.,Bill O'Reilly (commentator),Conservatives
"Chris Dodd
Talking about Al-Qaeda attacking San Francisco and blowing up San Francisco.
Bill O'Reilly
When did I say that, Senator?
Chris Dodd
That's not offensive?
Bill O'Reilly
When did I say that?
Chris Dodd
You said it in 2005, I think is correct?
Bill O'Reilly
When? Where? What forum? When?
Chris Dodd
Right here, I believe, on your own show.
Bill O'Reilly
No, you're wrong. I didn't say it here. You don't know what the hell I said, with all due respect.",Bill O'Reilly (commentator),Conservatives

"And I couldn't get over the fact that there was no difference between Sylvia's Restaurant and any other restaurant in New York City. I mean, it was exactly the same, even though it's run by blacks, primarily black patronship. It was the same.",Bill O'Reilly (commentator),Conservatives
"There wasn't one person in Sylvia's who was screaming, ""MFer, I want more iced tea."" You know, I mean everybody was— it was like goin' into an Italian restaurant in an all-white suburb, in the sense of people were sitting there and they were ordering and having fun, and there wasn't any kinda craziness at all.",Bill O'Reilly (commentator),Conservatives

"It's all coming from the haters on the far left. Just throw it in the garbage. But the regular folks who really enjoy this program, what we want you to ask, Laurie, is why do we do things? Why do we do them?",Bill O'Reilly (commentator),Conservatives
"On the pinhead front, 16-year-old Jamie Lynn Spears is pregnant. The sister of Britney says she is shocked. I bet. Now most teens are pinheads in some ways. But here the blame falls primarily on the parents of the girl, who obviously have little control over her....",Bill O'Reilly (commentator),Conservatives
"Bill O'Reilly
You know, what's the difference between the Ku Klux Klan and Arianna Huffington? What's the difference?

"If they wanna be nonbelievers, I don't care, that's up to them, but it's just as much of a stretch to be an atheist as it is to believe in God, because there's no explanation for how the planet got here, and Hawkings [sic] doesn't have it.",Bill O'Reilly (commentator),Conservatives
"Every fair-minded person should support government safety nets for people who need assistance through no fault of their own. But guys like McDermott don't make distinctions like that. For them, the baby Jesus wants us to ""provide,"" no matter what the circumstance. But being a Christian, I know that while Jesus promoted charity at the highest level, he was not self-destructive.",Bill O'Reilly (commentator),Conservatives
"I'll tell you why it's not a scam, in my opinion, all right? Tide goes in, tide goes out, never a miscommunication. You can't explain that.",Bill O'Reilly (commentator),Conservatives
"It's not a traditional America anymore. And there are 50% of the voting public who want stuff. They want things, and who is going to give them things? President Obama. He knows it, and he ran on it. And whereby 20 years ago, President Obama would have be roundly defeated by an establishment candidate like Mitt Romney. The white establishment is now the minority. And the voters, many of them, feel that this economic system is stacked against them and they want stuff.",Bill O'Reilly (commentator),Conservatives

It is a phil-o-so-phy.",Bill O'Reilly (commentator),Conservatives

"History will record that the two biggest deficits of the Obama administration were the failure to create a robust economy and the president's retreat from the terrorist battlefield. For years, Talking Points has been telling you the Obama administration has no strategy to defeat the ISIS threat. But President Obama somehow does not seem to understand that the civilized world is losing the fight against ISIS. Just hours before the Paris attack the president said 'we have contained' ISIS. Obviously that is not true. They are a threat worldwide, they continue to kill people with impunity. Nevertheless, the president is unrepentant and unwilling to admit that his strategy has failed. At a press conference today in Turkey he said, 'The strategy we're pursing is the right one.' The Republican Party is taking note. Senator Ted Cruz says 'Barack Obama does not wish to defend the country,' and Senator Lindsey Graham warns, 'There's a 9/11 coming, and it's coming from Syria if we don't disrupt their operations inside of Syria.' It is long past time that we the people demand ISIS be defeated, not contained.",Bill O'Reilly (commentator),Conservatives
