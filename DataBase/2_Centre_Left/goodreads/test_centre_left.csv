Robert Reich,"What are called 'public schools' in many of America's wealthy communities aren't really 'public' at all. In effect, they're private schools, whose tuition is hidden away in the purchase price of upscale homes there, and in the corresponding property taxes.",no,Progressive

Robert Reich,"The job creators are members of America's vast middle class and the poor, whose purchases cause businesses to expand and invest.",no,Progressive

Robert Reich,"We never used to blink at taking a leadership role in the world. And we understood leadership often required something other than drones and bombs.

Nicholas Kristof,"The wilderness is healing, a therapy for the soul.",no,Progressive
Nicholas Kristof,"Our world is enriched when coders and marketers dazzle us with smartphones and tablets, but, by themselves, they are just slabs. It is the music, essays, entertainment and provocations that they access, spawned by the humanities, that animate them - and us.",no,Progressive

They provide context.",no,Progressive
Nicholas Kristof,"I've always been interested in public health approaches because it seems to me we have this yearning for silver bullets, and that is not in fact how change comes about.

Nicholas Kristof,"Perhaps no country in Latin America is more picturesque than Bolivia, and the most memorable Bolivian city may be Potosi.",no,Progressive
Nicholas Kristof,"Most of the time in the 21st century, we dominate our surroundings: We tweak the thermostat, and the temperature falls one degree. We push a button, and Taylor Swift sings for us.

Nicholas Kristof,"Inequality causes problems by creating fissures in societies, leaving those at the bottom feeling marginalized or disenfranchised.",no,Progressive
Nicholas Kristof,"Humans pull together in an odd way when they're in the wilderness. It's astonishing how few people litter and how much they help one another.

Nicholas Kristof,"One of the most crucial kinds of intervention is in advocacy. We can think about charities in the context of delivering services, and indeed that is part of their job, but advocacy is also getting governments to step up to the plate. They can also give more voice to those who don't have one.",no,Progressive
Nicholas Kristof,"One of the aims of higher education is to broaden perspectives, and what better way than by a home stay in a really different country, like Bangladesh or Senegal? Time abroad also leaves one more aware of the complex prism of suspicion through which the United States is often viewed.",no,Progressive
Nicholas Kristof,"Sure, food stamps are occasionally misused, but anyone familiar with business knows that the abuse of food subsidies is far greater in the corporate suite. Every time an executive wines and dines a hot date on the corporate dime, the average taxpayer helps foot the bill.",no,Progressive
Nicholas Kristof,"Wilderness trails constitute a rare space in America marked by economic diversity.

Nicholas Kristof,You no more have the right to risk others by failing to vaccinate than you do by sending your child to school with a hunting knife. Vaccination isn't a private choice but a civic obligation.,no,Progressive
Nicholas Kristof,"Individual storytelling is incredibly powerful.

Nicholas Kristof,Random violence is incredibly infectious.,no,Progressive
Nicholas Kristof,"In Angola, I visited 'HeroRats' that have been trained to sniff out land mines (and, in some countries, diagnose tuberculosis). In a day, they can clear 20 times as much of a minefield as a human, and they work for bananas!",no,Progressive

And giving them some of the tools to be better parents, to whittle away at that parenting gap, gives those kids a much better starting point in life.",no,Progressive
Nicholas Kristof,"We journalists are a bit like vultures, feasting on war, scandal and disaster. Turn on the news, and you see Syrian refugees, Volkswagen corruption, dysfunctional government. Yet that reflects a selection bias in how we report the news: We cover planes that crash, not planes that take off.",no,Progressive

Polly Toynbee,But the single overwhelming reason why jails are bursting is longer sentences given for more crimes.,no,Progressive
Polly Toynbee,"So what really works? Treatments in jail do some good, but it's mostly too late: finding a family and a job or just growing older make most prisoners eventually give up crime.",no,Progressive
Polly Toynbee,"Is anyone serious about the politics of happiness? David Cameron dipped a toe in the water, using the word lightly, but denying the hard policies it implies. Labour shies away from it, but should take up the challenge.",no,Progressive
Polly Toynbee,"It is now possible to quantify people's levels of happiness pretty accurately by asking them, by observation, and by measuring electrical activity in the brain, in degrees from terrible pain to sublime joy.",no,Progressive
Polly Toynbee,"Happiness is a real, objective phenomenon, scientifically verifiable. That means people and whole societies can now be measured over time and compared accurately with one another. Causes and cures for unhappiness can be quantified.",no,Progressive

Polly Toynbee,The strongest predictor of unhappiness is anyone who has had a mental illness in the last 10 years. It is an even stronger predictor of unhappiness than poverty - which also ranks highly.,no,Progressive

Robert Reich,"If nothing is done to counter present trends, the major fault line in American politics will no longer be between Democrats and Republicans, liberals and conservatives. It will be between the 'establishment'—political insiders, power brokers, the heads of American business, Wall Street, and the mainstream media—and an increasingly mad-as-hell populace determined to 'take back America' from them.",no,Progressive
Robert Reich,"Government doesn’t ""intrude"" on the ""free market."" It creates the market.",no,Progressive
Robert Reich,"Those who argue for ""less government"" area really arguing for a different government—often one that favors them or their patrons.",no,Progressive
Robert Reich,"The critical things to watch out for aren't the rare big events, such as the 2008 bailout of the Street itself, but the ongoing multitude of small rule changes that continuously alter the economic game. ... The ""free market"" is a myth that prevents us from examining these rule changes and asking whom they serve. The myth is therefore highly useful to those who do not wish such an examination to be undertaken.",no,Progressive

Ezra Klein,The thing to remember about being young is you eventually get old.,no,Progressive
Ezra Klein,"One of my big beliefs about Washington is that we highly overstate the power of individuals and highly underrate seeing Washington as a system, in general, but, in particular, we highly underrate the power of Congress.",no,Progressive
Ezra Klein,The idea of changing and fixing the problem of how news is presented on the Internet has been recognized for a long time.,no,Progressive
Ezra Klein,"When I talk to people about 'KnowMore', it is as an experiment. The biggest thing I'll say there is that we've learned a lot from 'KnowMore'.",no,Progressive
Ezra Klein,"My only advice is to try to get the job that's most like the job you want, rather than the one that's more prestigious. Always try to be the talent.",no,Progressive
Ezra Klein,Every newspaper in the country covers stories that other newspapers cover. Every industry is filled with people who are competing to do the best job providing a particular service.,no,Progressive
Ezra Klein,I think it's weird that the news cedes so much ground to Wikipedia. That isn't true in other informational sectors.,no,Progressive
